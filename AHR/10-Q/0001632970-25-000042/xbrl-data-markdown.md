| Basis Of Accounting Policy Policy Text Block | Interim Unaudited Financial DataOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full-year results may be less favorable. | c-1 |  |

| Commitments And Contingencies Disclosure Text Block | 10. Commitments and ContingenciesLitigationWe are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which, if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. | c-1 |  |
| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | 17. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance. | c-1 |  |

| Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities Disclosure Text Block | 9. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We recorded such derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability, as applicable, measured at fair value.The following table lists the derivative financial instruments held by us as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, which were included in other assets and other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (dollars in thousands):Fair ValueInstrumentNotional   AmountIndexInterest RateEffective DateMaturity DateMarch 31, 2025December 31, 2024Swap$275,000Daily SOFR3.74%02/01/2301/19/26$571$1,013Swap$275,000Daily SOFR4.41%08/08/2301/19/26(908)(909)Swap$350,000Daily SOFR3.51%01/20/2601/19/27(191)—Swap$200,000Daily SOFR3.52%01/20/2601/19/27(118)—$(646)$104As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we recorded a net (loss) gain in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $(750,000) and $6,417,000, respectively, as an (increase) decrease to total interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the change in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments. | c-1 |  |

| Earnings Per Share Text Block | 18. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, RSAs, common stock issued pursuant to the ESPP and limited OP units are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.The following participating securities were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such securities were anti-dilutive during the periods presented below:Three Months Ended March 31,20252024Nonvested TBUs443,835395,108Nonvested RSAs758,0661,118,215OP units2,004,2163,501,976For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,424,788and309,256nonvested PBUs, respectively, were treated as contingently issuable shares pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation. Such contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they were anti-dilutive during the period. | c-1 |  |

| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | 14. Income TaxesAs a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, pursuant to the Code. TRS may participate in services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.Current Income TaxFederal and state income taxes are generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRS. Foreign income taxes are generally a function of our income on our real estate located in the United Kingdom, or UK, and Isle of Man.Deferred TaxesDeferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (primarily basis differences between tax and financial reporting for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating loss that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.We recognize the effects of an uncertain tax position on the financial statements, when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the “more likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority. As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we did not have any tax benefits or liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established if we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are not realizable. As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our valuation allowance fully reserves the net deferred tax assets due to historical losses and inherent uncertainty of future income. We will continue to monitor industry and economic conditions and our ability to generate taxable income based on our business plan and available tax planning strategies, which would allow us to utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets and thereby allow us to reverse all, or a portion of, our valuation allowance in the future. | c-1 |  |

| Investments In Debt And Marketable Equity Securities And Certain Trading Assets Disclosure Text Block | 4. Debt Security Investment, NetOur investment in a commercial mortgage-backed debt security, or debt security, bears an interest rate on the stated principal amount thereof equal to4.24% per annum, the terms of which security provide for monthly interest-only payments.  The debt security was issued by an unaffiliated mortgage trust and represented an approximate10.0% beneficial ownership interest in such mortgage trust. The debt security is subordinate to all other interests in the mortgage trust and is not guaranteed by a government-sponsored entity. The debt security was originally due to mature on August 25, 2025 at an aggregate stated amount of $93,433,000.On each of February 1, 2024 and September 3, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of14senior housing properties in Oregon andfivesenior housing properties in Washington, respectively, from unaffiliated third parties, which are included in the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default.  Further, we extended the maturity dates of the related mortgage loans payable from August 25, 2025 to January 1, 2028, thereby extending the maturity date of our debt security investment. | c-1 |  |

Lines of Credit and Term Loan2024 Credit FacilityWe, through our operating partnership, as borrower, and certain of our subsidiaries, or the subsidiary guarantors, collectively, with us, as guarantors, are party to an amended loan agreement, or the 2024 Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America, KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank, Citizens Bank, National Association and a syndicate of other banks, as lenders, for a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount up to $1,150,000,000, or the 2024 Credit Facility. The 2024 Credit Facility consists of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate amount of $600,000,000and a senior unsecured term loan facility in the initial aggregate amount of $550,000,000. The proceeds of loans made under the 2024 Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes including for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing existing indebtedness and other corporate purposes not inconsistent with obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement. We may also obtain up to $25,000,000in the form of standby letters of credit pursuant to the 2024 Credit Facility. Unless defined herein, all capitalized terms under this “2024 Credit Facility” subsection are defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement.Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, the Revolving Loans mature on February 14, 2028, and may be extended forone12-month period, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. The Term Loan matures on January 19, 2027, and maynotbe extended. The maximum principal amount of the 2024 Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate incremental amount of $600,000,000, subject to: (i) the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement and (ii) at leastfivebusiness days’ prior written notice to Bank of America.At our option, the 2024 Credit Facility bears interest at varying rates based upon (i) Daily SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Daily SOFR Rate Loans or (ii) Term SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans. If, under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, there is an inability to determine the Daily SOFR or the Term SOFR, then the 2024 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans. The loans may be repaid in whole or in part without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.We are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the lenders’ commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement computed at (a)0.25% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is less than or equal to50% and (b)0.20% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is greater than50%, which fee shall be computed on the actual daily amount of the Available Commitments during the period for which payment is made and payable in arrears on a quarterly basis.The 2024 Credit Agreement requires us to add additional subsidiaries as guarantors in the event the value of the assets owned by the subsidiary guarantors falls below a certain threshold as set forth in the 2024 Credit Agreement.

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standard Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standard Update, or ASU, 2023-09,Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,or ASU 2023-09, which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We expect to include additional tax disclosures in the notes to our annual financial statements upon our adoption of ASU 2023-09 beginning with our 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and no other changes to our existing disclosures or consolidated financial statements are expected to result from the adoption of such standard.In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,or ASU 2024-03. Further, in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01,Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date, or ASU 2025-01. ASU 2024-03 requires new financial statement disclosure to be provided in the notes to the financial statements in a tabular presentation related to the disaggregation of certain expense captions presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations that include expense categories such as: (i) purchases of inventory; (ii) employee compensation; (iii) depreciation; and (iv) intangible asset amortization. ASU 2024-03 and ASU 2025-01 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. We are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures beginning with our 2027 Annual Report on Form 10-K. | c-1 |  |

Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend at various dates through 2107, excluding extension options. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. As of March 31, 2025, we had future lease payments of $1,566,000for an operating lease that had not yet commenced. Such operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2025 with a lease term offive years.The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically based on the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index and may also include other variable lease costs (i.e., common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance).

In March 2025, in connection with the termination of the Trilogy Credit Facility, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of $508,000primarily consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Trilogy Credit Facility. In February 2024, in connection with the replacement of our previous credit facility with the 2024 Credit Facility, we incurred an aggregate loss on extinguishment of $565,000due to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the senior unsecured revolving credit facility portion of our previous credit facility. Loss on extinguishment of debt is recorded as an increase to interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, for further discussion of our lines of credit. Amortization expense on lease inducement for both the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $87,000, which is recorded as a decrease to real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Receivables Policy Text Block | Resident and Tenant Receivables and AllowancesResident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | 16. Segment ReportingOur chief operating decision maker, or CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer and President, evaluates our business and makes resource allocations based onfouroperating segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. These operating segments are also our reportable segments.Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our OM buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our SHOP segment includes senior housing, which may provide assisted living care, independent living, memory care or skilled nursing services that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our triple-net leased properties segment includes senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital investments, which are single-tenant properties for which we lease the properties to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all property operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our triple-net leased properties segment includes our debt security investment.Our CODM evaluates the performance of our combined properties in each reportable segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, primarily based on net operating income, or NOI, for each segment. NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the operations of our properties. Our CODM also primarily uses NOI for each segment in the annual budget and forecasting process. Further, our CODM considers budget-to-actual variances in NOI on a quarterly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. We define segment NOI as total revenues, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, interest expense, gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interests, foreign currency gain or loss, other income or expense and income tax benefit or expense for each segment. We believe that segment NOI serves as an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. We also believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this performance measure.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance.

| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance. | c-1 |  |

| Use Of Estimates | Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the initial and recurring valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed through property acquisitions including through business combinations, goodwill and its impairment, revenues, allowance for credit losses, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and contingencies. These estimates are made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is currently available, as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. | c-1 |  |
