AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REIT, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
The use of the words “we,” “us” or “our” refers to American Healthcare REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, except where otherwise noted.
1. Organization and Description of Business
Overview and Background
American Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, outpatient medical, or OM, buildings and other healthcare-related facilities. We have built a fully-integrated management platform that operates clinical healthcare properties throughout the United States, and in the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. We own and operate our integrated senior health campuses and senior housing operating properties, or SHOP, utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure. We have also originated and acquired secured loans and may acquire other real estate-related investments in the future on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code.
Operating Partnership
We conduct substantially all of our operations through American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership, and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024
,
we owned
98.8
% and
98.7
%, respectively, of the operating partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining
1.2
% and
1.3
% of the OP units, respectively, were owned by the following limited partners: (i) AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Mathieu B. Streiff, one of our non-executive directors; and (ii) a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC. See Note 11, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 12, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.
Our Real Estate Investments Portfolio
We currently operate through
four
reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. As of March 31, 2025, we owned and/or operated
312
buildings and integrated senior health campuses representing approximately
19,031,000
square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, for an aggregate contract purchase price of $
4,523,782,000
. In addition, as of March 31, 2025, we also owned a real estate-related debt investment purchased for $
60,429,000
.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Presentation
Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.

Table of Contents
AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REIT, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) — (Continued)
We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control will own substantially all of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we owned a
98.8
% and
98.7
%, respectively, general partnership interest therein, and the remaining
1.2
% and
1.3
%, respectively, partnership interest was owned by the limited partners.
The accounts of our operating partnership are consolidated in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements because we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and have unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions (even if additional limited partners are admitted to our operating partnership). All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Interim Unaudited Financial Data
Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full-year results may be less favorable.
In preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, management has evaluated subsequent events through the financial statement issuance date. We believe that although the disclosures contained herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2025.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the initial and recurring valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed through property acquisitions including through business combinations, goodwill and its impairment, revenues, allowance for credit losses, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and contingencies. These estimates are made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is currently available, as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions.

Resident and Tenant Receivables and Allowances
Resident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standard Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standard Update, or ASU, 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,
or ASU 2023-09, which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We expect to include additional tax disclosures in the notes to our annual financial statements upon our adoption of ASU 2023-09 beginning with our 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and no other changes to our existing disclosures or consolidated financial statements are expected to result from the adoption of such standard.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,
or ASU 2024-03. Further, in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01,
Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date
, or ASU 2025-01. ASU 2024-03 requires new financial statement disclosure to be provided in the notes to the financial statements in a tabular presentation related to the disaggregation of certain expense captions presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations that include expense categories such as: (i) purchases of inventory; (ii) employee compensation; (iii) depreciation; and (iv) intangible asset amortization. ASU 2024-03 and ASU 2025-01 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. We are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statement disclosures beginning with our 2027 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Impairment of Real Estate Investment
As we continue to evaluate our properties based on their historical operating performance and our expected holding period, for the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recognized an impairment charge of $
21,706,000
for
one
OM building. The fair value of such OM was determined by the sales price from an executed purchase and sale agreement with a third-party buyer, which was considered a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. For three months ended March 31, 2024, we did
not
recognize any impairment of real estate investments.
Business Combination
On February 1, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of
14
senior housing properties in Oregon from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in our SHOP segment. These properties are part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment, as defined and described in Note 4. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $
94,461,000
at the time of acquisition. No cash consideration was exchanged as part of the transaction; however, we incurred transaction costs of $
2,636,000
related to the acquisition of such properties. See Note 4, Debt Security Investment, Net, for a further discussion. Based on quantitative and qualitative considerations, such business combination was not material to us and therefore, pro forma financial information was not provided.
We did not complete any real estate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

4. Debt Security Investment, Net
Our investment in a commercial mortgage-backed debt security, or debt security, bears an interest rate on the stated principal amount thereof equal to
4.24
% per annum, the terms of which security provide for monthly interest-only payments.  The debt security was issued by an unaffiliated mortgage trust and represented an approximate
10.0
% beneficial ownership interest in such mortgage trust. The debt security is subordinate to all other interests in the mortgage trust and is not guaranteed by a government-sponsored entity. The debt security was originally due to mature on August 25, 2025 at an aggregate stated amount of $
93,433,000
.
On each of February 1, 2024 and September 3, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of
14
senior housing properties in Oregon and
five
senior housing properties in Washington, respectively, from unaffiliated third parties, which are included in the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default.  Further, we extended the maturity dates of the related mortgage loans payable from August 25, 2025 to January 1, 2028, thereby extending the maturity date of our debt security investment.

2024 Credit Facility
We, through our operating partnership, as borrower, and certain of our subsidiaries, or the subsidiary guarantors, collectively, with us, as guarantors, are party to an amended loan agreement, or the 2024 Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America, KeyBank National Association, or KeyBank, Citizens Bank, National Association and a syndicate of other banks, as lenders, for a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount up to $
1,150,000,000
, or the 2024 Credit Facility. The 2024 Credit Facility consists of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate amount of $
600,000,000
and a senior unsecured term loan facility in the initial aggregate amount of $
550,000,000
. The proceeds of loans made under the 2024 Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes including for working capital, capital expenditures, refinancing existing indebtedness and other corporate purposes not inconsistent with obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement. We may also obtain up to $
25,000,000
in the form of standby letters of credit pursuant to the 2024 Credit Facility. Unless defined herein, all capitalized terms under this “2024 Credit Facility” subsection are defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement.
Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, the Revolving Loans mature on February 14, 2028, and may be extended for
one
12
-month period, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. The Term Loan matures on January 19, 2027, and may
not
be extended. The maximum principal amount of the 2024 Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate incremental amount of $
600,000,000
, subject to: (i) the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement and (ii) at least
five
business days’ prior written notice to Bank of America.
At our option, the 2024 Credit Facility bears interest at varying rates based upon (i) Daily SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Daily SOFR Rate Loans or (ii) Term SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans. If, under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, there is an inability to determine the Daily SOFR or the Term SOFR, then the 2024 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans. The loans may be repaid in whole or in part without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.
We are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the lenders’ commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement computed at (a)
0.25
% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is less than or equal to
50
% and (b)
0.20
% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is greater than
50
%, which fee shall be computed on the actual daily amount of the Available Commitments during the period for which payment is made and payable in arrears on a quarterly basis.
The 2024 Credit Agreement requires us to add additional subsidiaries as guarantors in the event the value of the assets owned by the subsidiary guarantors falls below a certain threshold as set forth in the 2024 Credit Agreement. In the event of default, Bank of America has the right to terminate the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions under the 2024 Credit Agreement and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and all interest accrued and unpaid thereon.

As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our aggregate borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facility was $
1,150,000,000
, excluding the $
25,000,000
standby letters of credit described above. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility totaled $
643,000,000
($
642,567,000
, net of deferred financing costs related to the senior unsecured term loan facility portion of the 2024 Credit Facility), and $
689,000,000
($
688,502,000
, net of deferred financing costs related to the senior unsecured term loan facility portion of the 2024 Credit Facility), respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on such borrowings outstanding was
5.67
% per annum.
Trilogy Credit Facility
We, through Trilogy RER, LLC, were party to an amended loan agreement, or the Trilogy Credit Agreement, by and among certain subsidiaries of Trilogy OpCo, LLC, Trilogy RER, LLC, and Trilogy Pro Services, LLC; KeyBank; CIT Bank, N.A.; Regions Bank; KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.; Regions Capital Markets; Bank of America; The Huntington National Bank; and a syndicate of other banks, as lenders named therein, with respect to a senior secured revolving credit facility that had an aggregate maximum principal amount of $
400,000,000
, consisting of: (i) a $
365,000,000
secured revolver supported by real estate assets and ancillary business cash flow and (ii) a $
35,000,000
accounts receivable revolving credit facility supported by eligible accounts receivable, or the Trilogy Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2024, our aggregate borrowing capacity under the Trilogy Credit Facility was $
400,000,000
and borrowings outstanding totaled $
32,000
with a weighted average interest rate of
7.30
% per annum. The Trilogy Credit Facility was originally due to mature on June 5, 2025. On March 3, 2025, we repaid all borrowings and terminated the Trilogy Credit Facility, and therefore as of March 31, 2025, we do not have any obligations under the Trilogy Credit Agreement.
9. Derivative Financial Instruments
We use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We recorded such derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability, as applicable, measured at fair value.
The following table lists the derivative financial instruments held by us as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, which were included in other assets and other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (dollars in thousands):

As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we recorded a net (loss) gain in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $(
750,000
) and $
6,417,000
, respectively, as an (increase) decrease to total interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the change in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.
See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.
10. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
We are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which, if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental Matters
We follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.
Other
Our other commitments and contingencies include the usual obligations of real estate owners and operators in the normal course of business, which include calls/puts to sell/acquire properties. In our view, these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
11. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we, through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, owned a
98.8
% and
98.7
%, respectively, general partnership interest in our operating partnership, and the remaining
1.2
% and
1.3
%, respectively, limited partnership interest in our operating partnership was owned by limited partners. Some of the limited partnership units outstanding had redemption features outside of our control and were accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interests presented outside of permanent equity prior to February 9, 2024. As a result of the closing of the February 2024 Offering, as defined and described in Note 12, and listing of our Common Stock, as defined and described in Note 12, on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, such redemption features are no longer outside of our control, and we reclassified the carrying amount of such interests as of such date to noncontrolling interests in total equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12, Equity, for a further discussion.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we own, through our operating partnership, approximately
98.0
% of the joint ventures with an affiliate of Meridian Senior Living, LLC, or Meridian, that own Pinnacle Beaumont ALF and Pinnacle Warrenton ALF. The noncontrolling interests held by Meridian have redemption features outside of our control and are accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interests in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We record the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests at the greater of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of net income or loss and distributions or (ii) the redemption value.
The changes in the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests consisted of the following for the periods presented below (in thousands):

shares of our preferred stock, $
0.01
par value per share. As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
no
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
Common Stock
Pursuant to our charter, as amended, we are authorized to issue
1,000,000,000
shares of our common stock, $
0.01
par value per share, whereby
200,000,000
shares are classified as Class T common stock,
100,000,000
shares are classified as Class I common stock and
700,000,000
shares are classified as Common Stock without any designation as to class or series.
On February 9, 2024, we closed our underwritten public offering, or the February 2024 Offering, and issued
64,400,000
shares of Common Stock for a total of $
772,800,000
in gross offering proceeds. In conjunction with the February 2024 Offering, such shares of Common Stock were listed on the NYSE, under the trading symbol “AHR” and began trading on February 7, 2024. We received $
724,625,000
in net offering proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount, which was primarily used to repay $
176,145,000
of mortgage loans payable and $
545,010,000
on our lines of credit in February 2024.
Following the closing of the February 2024 Offering and until August 5, 2024, we presented our Common Stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock, as separate classes of common stock within our condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of equity. Any references to Common Stock in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to our NYSE-listed shares of common stock, whereas Class T common stock and Class I common stock refer to our historical non-listed shares of common stock. This applies to all historical periods presented herein. On August 5, 2024, 180 days after the listing of our Common Stock shares on the NYSE, each share of our Class T common stock and Class I common stock automatically, and without any stockholder action, converted into
one
share of our listed Common Stock.
On September 20, 2024, we closed our follow-on underwritten public offering, or the September 2024 Offering, and issued
20,010,000
shares of Common Stock for a total of $
471,236,000
in gross offering proceeds. We received $
451,207,000

24.0
% minority membership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings LLC, or Trilogy REIT Holdings; (ii) repay $
116,000,000
of borrowings outstanding under the Trilogy Credit Facility; and (iii) repay $
78,000,000
of borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. See “Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity – Membership Interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings” section below for a further discussion of the purchase of such joint venture interest.
On November 18, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement and established an at-the-market equity offering program, or ATM Offering, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of Common Stock, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $
500,000,000
. Shares sold through the ATM Offering may be offered and sold in amounts to be determined by us from time to time, and are sold in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale in accordance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we issued an aggregate of
1,577,113
shares of Common Stock under the ATM Offering for gross proceeds of $
47,666,000
at an average gross price of $
30.22
per share. As of March 31, 2025, the remaining amount available under the ATM Offering for future sales of Common Stock was $
332,114,000
.
Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity
Membership Interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings
Prior to September 20, 2024, we were the indirect owner of a
76.0
% interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings pursuant to an amended joint venture agreement with an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc., or NHI. NHI indirectly owned a
24.0
% membership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings, and as such, for the three months ended March 31, 2024,
24.0
% of the net earnings of Trilogy REIT Holdings were allocated to noncontrolling interests.
On September 20, 2024, using the net proceeds from the September 2024 Offering, we exercised our option pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement to purchase NHI’s
24.0
% minority membership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings that was owned by NHI, for a total all-cash purchase price of $
258,001,000
. In connection with such purchase and as of September 20, 2024, we own

Other Noncontrolling Interests
As of March 31, 2025, we own a
100
% interest in a consolidated limited liability company that owned Lakeview IN Medical Plaza. We previously owned an
86.0
% interest in such company until February 6, 2024, when we purchased the remaining
14.0
% membership interest in such company from an unaffiliated third party for a contract purchase price of $
441,000
. As such, from January 1, 2024 through February 5, 2024,
14.0
% of the net earnings of Lakeview IN Medical Plaza were allocated to noncontrolling interests.
As discussed in Note 1, Organization and Description of Business, as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we, through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, owned a
98.8
% and
98.7
%, respectively, general partnership interest in our operating partnership and the remaining
1.2
% and
1.3
%, respectively, of the OP units in our operating partnership were owned by limited partners. Some of the limited partnership units outstanding had redemption features outside of our control and were accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interests presented outside of permanent equity prior to February 9, 2024. As a result of the closing of the February 2024 Offering and the listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE, such redemption features are no longer outside of our control and we reclassified the remaining carrying amount of such redeemable noncontrolling interests as of such date to noncontrolling interests in total equity. See Note 11, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, for a further discussion.
Equity Compensation Plans
AHR Incentive Plan
Pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated 2015 Incentive Plan, or the AHR Incentive Plan, our board (with respect to options and restricted shares of common stock granted to independent directors) or our compensation committee (with respect to any other award) may grant options, restricted shares of common stock, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights or other awards to our independent directors, officers, employees and consultants. The AHR Incentive Plan terminates on June 15, 2033, and the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to such plan is
4,000,000
shares.
Restricted common stock
Pursuant to the AHR Incentive Plan, through March 31, 2025, we granted an aggregate of
1,316,561
shares of our restricted common stock, or RSAs, as defined in the AHR Incentive Plan. RSAs were granted to our independent directors in connection with their initial election or re-election to our board or in consideration of their past services rendered, as well as to certain executive officers and key employees. RSAs generally have a vesting period between
one
to
four years
and are subject to continuous service through the vesting dates.

There were no transfers into and out of fair value measurement levels during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. The valuation of these instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. Such valuation reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, as well as option volatility. The fair values of our interest rate swaps were determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts were based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves.
We incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.
Although we determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative financial instruments fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with this instrument utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparty. However, as of March 31, 2025, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Financial Instruments Disclosed at Fair Value
Our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, mortgage loans payable and borrowings under our lines of credit and term loan.
We consider the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments based upon an evaluation of the underlying characteristics and market data, in light of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. The fair values of such financial instruments are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of our debt security investment is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates available to us for investments with similar terms and maturities. The fair values of our mortgage loans payable and our lines of credit and term loan are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using borrowing rates available to us for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities. We have determined that the valuations of our debt security investment, mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan are classified in Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

14. Income Taxes
As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, pursuant to the Code. TRS may participate in services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.
Current Income Tax
Federal and state income taxes are generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRS. Foreign income taxes are generally a function of our income on our real estate located in the United Kingdom, or UK, and Isle of Man.
Deferred Taxes
Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (primarily basis differences between tax and financial reporting for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating loss that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.
We recognize the effects of an uncertain tax position on the financial statements, when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the “more likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority. As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we did not have any tax benefits or liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established if we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are not realizable. As of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our valuation allowance fully reserves the net deferred tax assets due to historical losses and inherent uncertainty of future income. We will continue to monitor industry and economic conditions and our ability to generate taxable income based on our business plan and available tax planning strategies, which would allow us to utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets and thereby allow us to reverse all, or a portion of, our valuation allowance in the future.

The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. As of March 31, 2025, we had future lease payments of $
1,566,000
for an operating lease that had not yet commenced. Such operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2025 with a lease term of
five years
.
The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically based on the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index and may also include other variable lease costs (i.e., common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance). Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

16. Segment Reporting
Our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer and President, evaluates our business and makes resource allocations based on
four
operating segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. These operating segments are also our reportable segments.
Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our OM buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our SHOP segment includes senior housing, which may provide assisted living care, independent living, memory care or skilled nursing services that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our triple-net leased properties segment includes senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital investments, which are single-tenant properties for which we lease the properties to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all property operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our triple-net leased properties segment includes our debt security investment.
Our CODM evaluates the performance of our combined properties in each reportable segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, primarily based on net operating income, or NOI, for each segment. NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the operations of our properties. Our CODM also primarily uses NOI for each segment in the annual budget and forecasting process. Further, our CODM considers budget-to-actual variances in NOI on a quarterly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. We define segment NOI as total revenues, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, interest expense, gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interests, foreign currency gain or loss, other income or expense and income tax benefit or expense for each segment. We believe that segment NOI serves as an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. We also believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this performance measure.
Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. Non-segment assets primarily consist of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, deferred financing costs, operating lease right-of-use asset and other assets not attributable to individual properties.

17. Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution.

Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, RSAs, common stock issued pursuant to the ESPP and limited OP units are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.
The following participating securities were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such securities were anti-dilutive during the periods presented below:

Overview and Background
American Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed REIT that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, outpatient medical, or OM, buildings, and other healthcare-related facilities. We have built a fully-integrated management platform that operates clinical healthcare properties throughout the United States, and in the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. We own and operate our integrated senior health campuses and senior-housing operating properties, or SHOP, utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure. We have also originated and acquired secured loans and may acquire other real estate-related investments in the future on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code.
Operating Partnership
We conduct substantially all of our operations through American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership, and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024
,
we owned 98.8% and 98.7%, respectively, of the operating partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining 1.2% and 1.3% of the OP units, respectively, were owned by the following limited partners: (i) AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Mathieu B. Streiff, one of our non-executive directors; and (ii) a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC. See Note 11, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 12, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.
Our Real Estate Investments Portfolio
We currently operate through four reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. As of March 31, 2025, we owned and/or operated 312 buildings and integrated senior health campuses, representing approximately 19,031,000 square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, for an aggregate contract purchase price of $4,523,782,000. In addition, as of March 31, 2025, we also owned a real estate-related debt investment purchased for $60,429,000.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying footnotes. These estimates are made and evaluated on an ongoing basis using information that is currently available, as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. The complete listing of our Critical Accounting Estimates was previously disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2025, and there have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates as disclosed therein, except as included within Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Interim Unaudited Financial Data
For a discussion of interim unaudited financial data, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Interim Unaudited Financial Data, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2025.
Acquisitions and Dispositions in 2025
For a discussion of our acquisitions and dispositions of investments in 2025, see Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations
Other than the effects of inflation discussed below, as well as other national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, and as otherwise disclosed in our risk factors, we are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, disposition, management and operation of our properties. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results or performance, see “Forward-Looking Statements” above and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those Risk Factors previously disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2025.
Inflation
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, inflation has affected our operations. The annual rate of inflation in the United States was 2.4% in March 2025 and 3.5% in March 2024, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. We believe inflation has impacted our operations such that we have experienced, and continue to experience, increases in the cost of labor, services, energy and supplies, and therefore continued inflationary pressures on our integrated senior health campuses and SHOP could continue to impact our profitability in future periods. To offset the impact of inflation on the cost of labor and services, we had our RIDEA managers bill higher than average annual rent and care fee increases for existing residents in 2024 and 2025, as compared to prior years, while adjusting market rates as frequently as needed based on competitor pricing and market conditions. We believe this practice will improve operating performance in our integrated senior health campuses and SHOP, as well as increase rent coverage and the stability of our real estate revenue in our triple-net leased properties over time.
For properties that are not operated under a RIDEA structure, there are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that help us mitigate the impact of inflation. These provisions include negotiated rental increases, which historically range from 2% to 3% per year, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements. However, due to the long-term nature of existing leases, among other factors, the leases may not reset frequently enough to cover inflation.
In addition, inflation has also caused an increase in the cost of our variable-rate debt due to historically rising interest rates. See
Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion.
Scheduled Lease Expirations
Excluding our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses, as of March 31, 2025, our properties were 89.9% leased, and, during the remainder of 2025, 10.0% of the leased GLA is scheduled to expire. Our leasing strategy focuses on negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the next 12 months. In the future, if we are unable to negotiate renewals, we will try to identify new tenants or collaborate with existing tenants who are seeking additional space to occupy. As of March 31, 2025, our remaining weighted average lease term was 6.7 years, excluding our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses.
Our combined SHOP and integrated senior health campuses were 87.6% leased as of March 31, 2025. Substantially all of our leases with residents at such properties are for a term of one year or less.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
Our operating results are primarily comprised of income derived from our portfolio of properties and expenses in connection with the acquisition and operation of such properties. Our primary sources of revenue include rent generated by our leased, non-RIDEA properties and resident fees and services revenue from our RIDEA properties. Our primary expenses include property operating expenses and rental expenses. In general, we expect such revenues and expenses related to our portfolio of RIDEA properties to increase in the future due to an overall increase in occupancies, resident fees and pricing of care services provided.
We segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management reviews our performance and makes operating decisions. As of March 31, 2025, we operated through four reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties.

Table of Contents
The most significant drivers behind changes in our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the corresponding period in 2024 were primarily due to: the increase in resident occupancies and billing rates; the adverse impact of inflation, which resulted in increases in the cost of labor, services, energy and supplies; and our acquisitions and dispositions of investments. Additional information behind the changes in our consolidated results of operations is discussed in more detail below. See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our acquisitions and dispositions during 2025. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024, we owned and/or operated the following types of properties (dollars in thousands):

Revenues
Our primary sources of revenue include resident fees and services revenue generated by our RIDEA properties and rent from our leased, non-RIDEA properties. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, resident fees and services revenue primarily consisted of rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary services, and real estate revenue primarily consisted of base rent and expense recoveries. The amount of revenues generated by our RIDEA properties depends principally on our ability to maintain resident occupancy rates. The amount of revenues generated by our non-RIDEA properties is dependent on our ability to maintain tenant occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease available space at the then existing rental rates.

Resident Fees and Services Revenue
For our integrated senior health campuses segment, we increased resident fees and services revenue by $30,242,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to increased resident occupancy and higher resident fees as a result of an increase in billing rates and levels of service.
For our SHOP segment, resident fees and services revenue increased $14,816,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to: (i) an increase of $4,771,000 due to the acquisition of five senior housing properties in Washington in September 2024; (ii) an increase of $4,348,000 due to the acquisition of 14 senior housing properties in Oregon in February 2024; and (iii) an increase of $1,043,000 due to the acquisition of one senior housing property in Georgia in October 2024. The remaining increase in resident fees and services
37
Table of Contents
revenue for our SHOP segment was primarily attributable to increased resident occupancy and higher resident fees as a result of an increase in billing rates.
Real Estate Revenue
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, real estate revenue within our triple-net leased properties segment decreased $3,115,000, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of eight triple-net leased properties in Missouri in December 2024 and straight-line rent adjustment recognized in connection with the early extension of a tenant lease at one of our triple-net leased properties.
Real estate revenue for our OM segment decreased $873,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to dispositions of OM buildings in 2024.
Property Operating Expenses and Rental Expenses
Integrated senior health campuses and SHOP typically have a higher percentage of direct operating expenses to revenue than OM buildings and triple-net leased properties due to the nature of RIDEA-type facilities where we conduct day-to-day operations. Property operating expenses and property operating expenses as a percentage of resident fees and services revenue, as well as rental expenses and rental expenses as a percentage of real estate revenue, by reportable segment consisted of the following for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, the increase in total property operating expenses for our integrated senior health campuses segment was predominately due to: (i) increased resident occupancy at the facilities within such segment; and (ii) an increase of $2,511,000 within Trilogy’s ancillary business unit due to higher labor costs associated with the expansion of services offered and inflation’s impact on labor costs and other operating expenses.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, total property operating expenses for our SHOP segment increased primarily due to: (i) an increase of $3,795,000 due to the acquisition of 14 senior housing properties in Oregon in February 2024; (ii) an increase of $3,688,000 due to the acquisition of five senior housing properties in Washington in September 2024; and (iii) an increase of $905,000 due to the acquisition of one senior housing property in Georgia in October 2024.
Rental expenses for our OM segment decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to the dispositions of OM buildings in 2024.

The decrease in total interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to an $11,352,000 decrease in interest expense related to a decrease in debt balances. Such decrease in debt balances was predominately a result of the payoff of our variable-rate mortgage loans payable and paydown of our variable-rate lines of credit using net proceeds raised from equity offerings during 2024. Such decrease in total interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, was partially offset by the $7,167,000 change from gain to loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Gain or Loss on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recognized an aggregate loss on sale of $359,000 primarily related to the sale of one SHOP and one integrated senior health campus. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recognized an aggregate net gain on dispositions of our real estate investments of $2,263,000 related to the sale of two OM buildings and one SHOP. See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net — Dispositions of Real Estate Investments, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion.
Impairment of Real Estate Investments
As we continued to evaluate our properties based on their historical operating performance and our expected holding period, for the three months ended March 31, 2025, we determined that one of our OM buildings was impaired and recognized an impairment charge of $21,706,000. See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net — Impairment of Real Estate Investments, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we did not recognize impairment charges on real estate investments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, net proceeds from the issuances of equity securities, including through our ATM Offering (as defined and described at Note 12, Equity – Common Stock, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), borrowings under our line of credit and proceeds from the disposition of real estate investments. For the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements (including principal and interest); (iii) fund the acquisition of real estate investments, development activities and capital expenditures; and (iv) make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter. We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.

Material Cash Requirements
Capital Improvement Expenditures
A capital plan for each investment is established upon acquisition that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment, including costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan also sets forth the anticipated sources of the necessary capital, which may include operating cash generated by the investment, capital reserves, a line of credit or other loan established with respect to the investment, other borrowings or additional equity investments from us and joint venture partners. The capital plan for each investment is adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs. As of March 31, 2025, we had $13,654,000 of restricted cash in loan impounds and reserve accounts to fund a portion of such capital expenditures. Based on the budget for the properties we owned as of March 31, 2025, we estimate that expenditures for capital and tenant improvements as of such date are approximately $61,066,000 for the remaining nine months of 2025, although actual expenditures are predominantly discretionary and are dependent on many factors which are not presently known.
Contractual Obligations
The following table provides information with respect to: (i) the maturity and scheduled principal repayment of our secured mortgage loans payable and line of credit and term loan; (ii) interest payments on our mortgage loans payable and line of credit and term loan, excluding the effect of our interest rate swaps; (iii) operating lease obligations; and (iv) financing and other obligations as of March 31, 2025 (in thousands):

As of March 31, 2025, our borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facility was $1,150,000,000. As of March 31, 2025, our borrowings outstanding under such credit facility was $643,000,000, and we had $507,000,000 available on such facility. We believe that such resource will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next 12 months and the longer term thereafter.

The following summary discussion of our changes in our cash flows is based on our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
Operating Activities
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, cash flows from operating activities were primarily related to property operations, offset by payments of general and administrative expenses and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness. In general, cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of cash receipts and payments, and have increased since 2024 primarily due to improved resident occupancy and expense management at our properties operated under a RIDEA structure. The change from net cash used in operating activities to net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the increase in operating performance of our real estate investments in our integrated senior health campuses and SHOP segments, as well as a decrease in interest paid on our outstanding indebtedness as a result of mortgage payoffs and paydowns on our lines of credit using net proceeds from our equity offerings in 2024 and 2025. See the “Results of Operations” section above for a further discussion.
Investing Activities
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $16,090,000 increase in cash paid to acquire real estate investments, a $4,947,000 decrease in proceeds from dispositions of real estate investments and $3,355,000 in deposits paid in pursuit of future real estate investments.
Financing Activities
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, the change from net cash provided by financing activities to net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a $725,134,000 decrease in gross equity offering proceeds and a $22,952,000 increase in distributions paid. Such amounts were partially offset by a $602,862,000 decrease in net payments on our lines of credit and mortgage loans payable primarily using the net proceeds from equity offerings, a $46,943,000 decrease in the payment of offering costs, a $5,579,000 decrease in deferred financing costs paid, as well as a $25,312,000 decrease in cash paid to redeem certain equity interests owned in Trilogy Investors, LLC.
Distributions
Our board shall authorize distributions, if any, on a quarterly basis, in such amounts as our board shall determine, and each quarterly record date for the purposes of such distributions shall be determined and authorized by our board in the last month of each calendar quarter until such time as our board changes our distribution policy.
Our board has authorized a quarterly distribution equal to $0.25 per share to holders of our common stock, which we expect will continue to be paid in the future, though we cannot guarantee that our distributions will continue at the current value or at all. Such quarterly distributions were equal to an annualized distribution rate of $1.00 per share and paid in cash, only from legally available funds. The amount of the quarterly distributions paid to our common stockholders was determined by our board and was dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code.
The following tables reflect distributions we paid for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the sources of distributions as compared to cash flows from operations or funds from operations attributable to controlling interest, or FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure (dollars in thousands):

As of March 31, 2025, any distributions of amounts in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits have resulted in a return of capital to our stockholders, and some portion of a distribution to our stockholders may have been paid from borrowings.

Lines of Credit and Term Loan
For a discussion of our lines of credit and term loan, see Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
REIT Requirements
In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute to our stockholders a minimum of 90.0% of our REIT taxable income. Existing Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, guidance includes a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly offered REITs can satisfy the distribution requirement by distributing a combination of cash and stock to stockholders. In general, to qualify under the safe harbor, each stockholder must elect to receive either cash or stock, and the aggregate cash component of the distribution to stockholders must represent at least 20.0%
of the total distribution
. In the event that there is a shortfall in net cash available due to factors including, without limitation, the timing of such distributions or the timing of the collection of receivables, we may seek to obtain capital to make distributions by means of unsecured and secured debt financing through one or more unaffiliated third parties. We may also make distributions with cash from capital transactions including, without limitation, the sale of one or more of our properties.
Commitments and Contingencies
For a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Debt Service Requirements
A significant liquidity need is the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. As of March 31, 2025, we had $1,023,241,000 of fixed-rate mortgage loans payable outstanding secured by our properties. As of March 31, 2025, we had $643,000,000 outstanding, and $507,000,000 remained available under our line of credit. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt, factoring in our interest rate swaps, was 4.39% per annum as of March 31, 2025. See Note 7, Mortgage Loans Payable, Net, and Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
We are required by the terms of certain loan documents to meet various financial and non-financial covenants, such as leverage ratios, net worth ratios, debt service coverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements on our mortgage loans payable and our line of credit and term loan. If any future covenants are violated, we anticipate seeking a waiver or amending the debt covenants with the lenders when and if such event should occur. However, there can be no assurances that management will be able to effectively achieve such plans.

Funds from Operations and Normalized Funds from Operations
Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of funds from operations is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure, and our management uses FFO to evaluate our performance over time. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.
We define FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on funds from operations approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines funds from operations as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT’s policy described above.
Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our operating performance to investors, industry analysts and our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss).
We define normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest, or Normalized FFO, as FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): expensed acquisition fees and costs, which we refer to as business acquisition expenses; amounts relating to changes in deferred rent and amortization of above- and below-market leases; the non-cash impact of changes to our equity instruments; non-cash or non-recurring income or expense; the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; capitalized interest; impairment of intangible assets and goodwill; amortization of closing costs on debt security investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect Normalized FFO on the same basis.
However, FFO and Normalized FFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance, GAAP cash flows from operations as an indicator of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and Normalized FFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and Normalized FFO. Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors, industry analysts and management as they compare the operating performance used by the REIT industry, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate funds from operations and normalized funds from operations the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and Normalized FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. None of the SEC, NAREIT, or any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or Normalized FFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or Normalized FFO.

Net Operating Income
Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interests, foreign currency gain or loss, other income or expense and income tax benefit or expense.
NOI is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity. NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss). NOI should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance.
We believe that NOI is an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the operations of our properties. We believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community and is useful to investors in understanding the profitability and operating performance of our property portfolio. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures, or in the methods we use to manage market risk, from those that were provided for in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2025.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire and develop properties and other investments. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate increases on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs while taking into account variable interest rate risk. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow or lend at fixed or variable rates.
We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We have not elected, and may continue to not elect, to apply hedge accounting treatment to these derivatives; therefore, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative financial instruments were recorded as a component of interest expense in gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of March 31, 2025, our interest rate swaps are recorded in other assets and other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at their aggregate fair value of $571,000 and $(1,217,000), respectively. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion.

Debt Security Investment, Net
As of March 31, 2025, the net carrying value of our debt security investment was $91,698,000. As we expect to hold our debt security investment to maturity and the amounts due under such debt security investment are limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our debt security investment, would have a significant impact on our operations. See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value of our investment in a held-to-maturity debt security. The effective interest rate on our debt security investment was 4.24% per annum as of March 31, 2025.
Mortgage Loans Payable, Net and Lines of Credit and Term Loan
Mortgage loans payable were $1,023,241,000 ($1,000,489,000, net of discount/premium and deferred financing costs) as of March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, we had 89 fixed-rate mortgage loans payable with effective interest rates ranging from 2.21% to 5.99% per annum and a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.72%. In addition, as of March 31, 2025, we had $643,000,000 ($642,567,000, net of deferred financing fees) outstanding under our line of credit and term loan, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.67% per annum.
As of March 31, 2025, the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt, factoring in our fixed-rate interest rate swaps, was 4.39% per annum. An increase in the variable interest rate on our variable-rate line of credit and term loan constitutes a market risk. As of March 31, 2025, a 0.50% increase in the market rates of interest would have increased our overall annualized interest expense on our variable-rate line of credit by $471,000, or 0.6% of total annualized interest expense on our line of credit and term loan. See Note 7, Mortgage Loans Payable, Net, and Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Other Market Risk
In addition to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the value of our future investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants and residents, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs.
As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of March 31, 2025 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of March 31, 2025, were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
For a discussion of our legal proceedings, see Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
There were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2025, other than as set forth below.
The use of, or inability to use, artificial intelligence by us, our operators, our tenants and our vendors presents risks and challenges that may adversely impact our business and operating results or the business and operating results of our operators and tenants or may adversely impact the demand for properties.
We may use generative artificial intelligence and/or machine learning, or AI, tools in our operations. If our peers use AI tools to optimize operations and we fail to utilize AI tools in a comparable manner, we may be competitively disadvantaged. However, while AI tools may facilitate optimization and operational efficiencies, they also have the potential for inaccuracy, bias, infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, and risks related to data privacy and cybersecurity. The use of AI tools may introduce errors or inadequacies that are not easily detectable, including deficiencies, inaccuracies or biases in the data used for AI training, or in the content, analyses or recommendations generated by AI applications. The results of such errors or inadequacies may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The legal requirements relating to AI continue to evolve and remain uncertain, including how legal developments could impact our business and ability to enforce our proprietary rights or protect against infringement of those rights.
Cybersecurity threat actors may utilize AI tools to automate and enhance cybersecurity attacks against us. We utilize software and platforms designed to detect such cybersecurity threats, including AI-based tools, but these threats could become more sophisticated and harder to detect and counteract, which may pose significant risks to our data security and systems. Such cybersecurity attacks, if successful, could lead to data breaches, loss of confidential or sensitive information and financial or reputational harm.
Our vendors may use AI tools in their products or services without our knowledge, and the providers of these tools may not meet the evolving regulatory or industry standards for privacy and data protection. Consequently, this may inhibit our or our vendors' ability to uphold an appropriate level of service and data privacy. If we, our vendors or other third parties with which we conduct business experience an actual or perceived breach of privacy or security incident due to the use of AI, we may be adversely impacted, lose valuable intellectual property or confidential information and incur harm to our reputation and the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures.
In addition, investors, analysts and other market participants may use AI tools to process, summarize or interpret our financial information or other data about us. The use of AI tools in financial and market analysis may introduce risks similar to those described above, including an inaccurate interpretation of our financial or operational performance or market trends or conditions, which in turn could result in inaccurate conclusions or investment recommendations.
Changes in federal, state or local laws or regulations may limit our opportunities to participate in the ownership of, or investment in, healthcare real estate.
Changes in federal, state, or local laws or regulations, including changes limiting REIT investment in the healthcare sector, reducing healthcare-related tax benefits for REITs, or requiring additional approvals for healthcare entities to transact with REITs, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in the ownership of or invest in healthcare providers and healthcare real estate. Legislation potentially impacting REIT ownership and investment in the healthcare sector has recently been introduced or is under discussion at the federal and state level. Such legislation or similar laws or regulations, if enacted, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
