NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
The use of the words “we,” “us” or “our” refers to American Healthcare REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, except where otherwise noted.
1. Organization and Description of Business
Overview and Background
American Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on outpatient medical buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, and other healthcare-related facilities. We have built a fully-integrated management platform that operates clinical healthcare properties throughout the United States, the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. We operate our integrated senior health campuses and senior housing operating properties, or SHOP, utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure. We have also originated and acquired secured loans and may originate or acquire other real estate-related investments in the future on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.
Operating Partnership
We conduct substantially all of our operations through American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership, and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of December 31, 2023
,
we owned
95.0
% of the operating partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining
5.0
% OP units were owned by the following limited partners: AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Mathieu B. Streiff, one of our directors; Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC; Flaherty Trust; and a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC. On August 19, 2024, Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC redeemed all of its OP units in exchange for
1,216,571
shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and as a result, is no longer a limited partner of our operating partnership. As of September 30, 2024, we owned
98.5
% of the OP units in our operating partnership, and the remaining
1.5
% of the OP units were owned by the remaining limited partners. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 13, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.
Public Offerings and Listing
We issued an aggregate
65,445,557
shares of Class T common stock and Class I common stock, for a total of $
2,737,716,000
in gross offering proceeds, since February 26, 2014 in our initial public offerings and our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, offerings. Our initial public offerings were terminated as of April 2019.
On February 9, 2024, pursuant to a Registration Statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on Form S-11 (File No. 333-267464), as amended, we closed our underwritten public offering, or the February 2024 Offering, through which we issued
64,400,000
shares of Common Stock, for a total of $
772,800,000
in gross offering proceeds. Such amounts include the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional
8,400,000
shares of Common Stock. These shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the trading symbol “AHR” and began trading on February 7, 2024.
Following the closing of the February 2024 Offering and until August 5, 2024, we presented Common Stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock, or collectively, common stock, as separate classes within our condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of equity. Any references to “Common Stock” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to our NYSE-listed shares sold through the February 2024 Offering or the September 2024 Offering, as defined below, whereas Class T common stock and Class I common stock refer to our classes of common stock that were not NYSE-listed. This applies to all historical periods presented herein. On August 5, 2024, 180 days after the listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE, each share of our Class T common stock and Class I common stock automatically converted into one share of our listed Common Stock.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) — (Continued)
On September 20, 2024, we closed our additional underwritten public offering, or the September 2024 Offering, under a prospectus supplement and related prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to our effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-281488). Through the September 2024 Offering, we issued
20,010,000
shares of Common Stock, for a total of $
471,236,000
in gross offering proceeds. Such amounts include the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional
2,610,000
shares of Common Stock. These shares are listed on NYSE under the trading symbol “AHR” and began trading on September 19, 2024.
See Note 13, Equity — Common Stock, and Note 13, Equity — Distribution Reinvestment Plan, for a further discussion of our public offerings.
Our Real Estate Investments Portfolio
We currently operate through
four
reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, outpatient medical, or OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. As of September 30, 2024, we owned and/or operated
324
buildings and integrated senior health campuses, representing approximately
19,676,000
square feet of gross leasable area, for an aggregate contract purchase price of $
4,666,399,000
. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we also owned a real estate-related debt investment purchased for $
60,429,000
.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Presentation
Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.
We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control will own substantially all of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owned a
98.5
% and
95.0
%, respectively, general partnership interest therein, and the remaining
1.5
% and
5.0
%, respectively, partnership interest was owned by limited partners.
The accounts of our operating partnership are consolidated in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements because we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and have unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions (even if additional limited partners are admitted to our operating partnership). All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Interim Unaudited Financial Data
Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full-year results may be less favorable.

AMERICAN HEALTHCARE REIT, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) — (Continued)
In preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, management has evaluated subsequent events through the financial statement issuance date. We believe that although the disclosures contained herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the initial and recurring valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed through property acquisitions including through business combinations, goodwill and its impairment, revenues and grant income, allowance for credit losses, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and contingencies. These estimates are made and evaluated on an ongoing basis using information that is currently available, as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions.

Resident and Tenant Receivables and Allowances
Resident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Properties Held for Sale
We classify a property or group of operating properties as held for sale in the period when certain criteria are met, such as we commit to a plan to sell the property and have determined that the sale is probable. Upon classification of a property as held for sale, we record the property at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In addition, a property being held for sale ceases to be depreciated.
Our properties held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of $
0
and $
3,477,000
, respectively, are included in other assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we disposed of
one
of our SHOP that was held for sale for a contract sales price of $
4,500,000
and recognized a gain on sale of $
645,000
. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did
not
dispose of any held for sale properties. See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net — Dispositions of Real Estate Investments, for a further discussion of our property dispositions.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily include reimbursement of payroll-related costs to the managers of our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses of $
50,966,000
and $
42,698,000
, respectively, insurance reserves of $
46,312,000
and $
44,548,000
, respectively, accrued distributions to common stockholders of $
38,218,000
and $
16,557,000
, respectively, accrued property taxes of $

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,
or ASU 2023-07, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. Such disclosure amendments include the requirement for public entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance and expect to have additional disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,
or ASU 2023-09, which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules,
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors
. The final rules require a registrant to disclose, among other things: material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks, as well as a quantitative and qualitative description of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that directly result from such mitigation or adaptation activities; material capitalized costs, expenses and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions; information about the registrant’s board of directors’ oversight of climate-related risks and management’s role in managing

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) — (Continued)
material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant’s business, results of operations or financial condition. The rules require registrants to provide such climate-related disclosures in their annual reports, beginning with annual reports for the year ending December 31, 2025 for calendar-year-end large accelerated filers. In April 2024, the SEC stayed the final rules in response to legal challenges to the rules. As a result, it is not clear whether current compliance deadlines will be extended once the litigation is resolved. We are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact to our consolidated financial statement disclosures.

Impairment of Real Estate Investments
For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did
no
t recognize any impairment of real estate investments. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as we continued to evaluate additional non-strategic properties for sale, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $
12,510,000
for
two
SHOP, which reduced the total aggregate carrying value of such assets to $
15,977,000
. The remaining $
3,477,000
carrying value of
one
such SHOP was then reclassified to properties held for sale during the third quarter of 2023, and sold in January 2024. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Properties Held for Sale, for a further discussion of such disposition. Further, the fair value of such SHOP was based on its projected sales price from independent third-party letters of intent, which were considered Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the other SHOP was determined by a third-party appraiser based on the sales comparison approach with the most significant inputs based on a price per unit and price per square foot analysis within the area for similar types of assets. The ranges of these inputs were $
190,000
to $
200,000
per unit and $
250
to $
260
per square foot, which were considered Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.

4. Business Combinations
On February 1, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of
14
senior housing properties in Oregon from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in our SHOP segment. These properties are part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment, as defined and described in Note 5. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $
94,461,000
at the time of acquisition. No cash consideration was exchanged as part of the transaction; however, we incurred transaction costs of $
2,636,000
related to the acquisition of such properties. See Note 5, Debt Security Investment, Net, for a further discussion.
On September 3, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of
five
senior housing properties in Washington from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in our SHOP segment. These properties are also part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $
36,178,000
at the time of acquisition. No cash consideration was exchanged as part of the transaction; however, we incurred transaction costs of $
2,904,000
related to the acquisition of such properties. See Note 5, Debt Security Investment, Net, for a further discussion.
On February 15, 2023, we, through Trilogy, acquired from an unaffiliated third party, a
60.0
% controlling interest in a privately held company, Memory Care Partners, LLC, or MCP, that operated integrated senior health campuses located in Kentucky. The contract purchase price for the acquisition of MCP was $
900,000
, which was acquired using cash on hand. Prior to such acquisition, we owned a
40.0
% interest in MCP, which was accounted for as an equity method investment and was included in investments in unconsolidated entities within other assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in MCP, we now own a
100
% controlling interest in MCP. As a result, we re-measured the fair value of our previously held equity interest in MCP and recognized a gain on re-measurement of $
726,000
in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Based on quantitative and qualitative considerations, such business combinations were not material to us individually or in the aggregate and therefore, pro forma financial information is not provided. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminary estimates at acquisition.
Any necessary adjustments are finalized within one year from the date of acquisition.

5. Debt Security Investment, Net
Our investment in a commercial mortgage-backed debt security, or debt security, bears an interest rate on the stated principal amount thereof equal to
4.24
% per annum, the terms of which security provide for monthly interest-only payments. The debt security matures on August 25, 2025 at an aggregate stated amount of $
93,433,000
, resulting in an anticipated yield-to-maturity of
10.0
% per annum. The debt security was issued by an unaffiliated mortgage trust and represents a
10.0
% beneficial ownership interest in such mortgage trust. The debt security is subordinate to all other interests in the mortgage trust and is not guaranteed by a government-sponsored entity.
On February 1, 2024 and September 3, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of
14
senior housing properties in Oregon and a portfolio of
five
senior housing properties in Washington, respectively, from unaffiliated third parties, which properties are included in the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. We did not grant any concessions to such borrower, and the carrying value of our debt security investment at the time of acquisition did not exceed the fair value of such properties. See Note 4, Business Combinations, for a further discussion of such acquisitions.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the debt security investment was $
90,144,000
and $
86,935,000
, respectively, net of unamortized closing costs of $
251,000
and $
489,000
, respectively. Accretion on the debt security for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $
1,168,000
and $
1,060,000
, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $
3,447,000
and $
3,126,000
, respectively, which is recorded as an increase to real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Amortization expense of closing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $
82,000
and $
71,000
, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $
238,000
and $
204,000
, respectively, which is recorded as a decrease to real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We evaluated credit quality indicators such as the agency ratings and the underlying collateral of such investment in order to determine expected future credit loss. No credit loss was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

12
-month period, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. The Term Loan matures on January 19, 2027, and may
not
be extended. The maximum principal amount of the 2024 Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate incremental amount of $
600,000,000
, subject to: (i) the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement and (ii) at least
five
business days’ prior written notice to Bank of America.
At our option, the 2024 Credit Facility bears interest at varying rates based upon (i) Daily SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Daily SOFR Rate Loans or (ii) Term SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans. If, under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, there is an inability to determine the Daily SOFR or the Term SOFR, then the 2024 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans. The loans may be repaid in whole or in part without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.
We are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the lenders’ commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement computed at (a)
0.25
% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is less than or equal to
50
% and (b)
0.20
% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is greater than
50
%, which fee shall be computed on the actual daily amount of the Available Commitments during the period for which payment is made and payable in arrears on a quarterly basis.
The 2024 Credit Agreement requires us to add additional subsidiaries as guarantors in the event the value of the assets owned by the subsidiary guarantors falls below a certain threshold as set forth in the 2024 Credit Agreement. In the event of default, Bank of America has the right to terminate the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions under the 2024 Credit Agreement and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and all interest accrued and unpaid thereon.
As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facility was $
1,150,000,000
, excluding the $
25,000,000

As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. On September 20, 2024, we terminated
one
interest rate swap that would have matured on June 5, 2025 and had a notional amount of $
200,000,000
. We paid a fee of $
415,000
related to such contract termination, which is recorded as loss on the early extinguishment of derivatives and included as an increase to interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a net (loss) gain in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $(
8,967,000
) and $
3,402,000
, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a net (loss) gain in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $(
2,162,000
) and $
8,200,000
, respectively, as a (increase)/decrease to total interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the change in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.
See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.
11. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
We are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which, if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) — (Continued)
Environmental Matters
We follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.
Other
Our other commitments and contingencies include the usual obligations of real estate owners and operators in the normal course of business, which include calls/puts to sell/acquire properties. In our view, these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
12. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we, through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, owned a
98.5
% and
95.0
%, respectively, general partnership interest in our operating partnership, and the remaining
1.5
% and
5.0
%, respectively, limited partnership interest in our operating partnership was owned by limited partners. Some of the limited partnership units outstanding, which accounted for approximately
1.0
% of our total operating partnership units outstanding as of December 31, 2023, had redemption features outside of our control and were accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interests presented outside of permanent equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the closing of the February 2024 Offering and listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE, such redemption features are no longer outside of our control, and we reclassed the carrying amount of such interests as of such date to noncontrolling interests in total equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. Further, additional paid-in capital was adjusted to reflect such change in presentation of limited partners interests. See Note 13, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion.
As of December 31, 2023, we, through Trilogy REIT Holdings LLC, or Trilogy REIT Holdings, in which we indirectly held a
76.0
% ownership interest, owned approximately
97.5
% of the outstanding equity interests of Trilogy. As of December 31, 2023, certain members of Trilogy’s management and certain members of an advisory committee to Trilogy’s board of directors owned approximately
2.5
% of the outstanding equity interests of Trilogy. We accounted for such equity interests as redeemable noncontrolling interests or other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets in accordance with FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 480-10-S99-3A, given certain features associated with such equity interests. In January 2024, we redeemed equity interests in Trilogy that were accounted for as other liabilities and owned by a member of Trilogy’s advisory committee for $
25,312,000
in cash. In April 2024, we redeemed all the remaining equity interests in Trilogy owned by members of Trilogy management and certain members of Trilogy’s advisory committee, including the redemption of Trilogy Profit Interests, as defined and described at Note 13, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity — Other Noncontrolling Interests, for an aggregate $
10,771,000
in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we redeemed the equity interests owned by certain members of Trilogy’s management for an aggregate of $
15,954,000
. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding equity interests of Trilogy owned by members of Trilogy’s management or members of Trilogy’s advisory committee.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we own, through our operating partnership, approximately
98.0
% of the joint ventures with an affiliate of Meridian Senior Living, LLC, or Meridian, that own Pinnacle Beaumont ALF and Pinnacle Warrenton ALF. The noncontrolling interests held by Meridian have redemption features outside of our control and are accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interests in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Distribution Reinvestment Plan
Our DRIP allowed our stockholders to elect to reinvest an amount equal to the distributions declared on their shares of common stock in additional shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving cash distributions. However, on November 14, 2022, our board suspended the DRIP offering beginning with the distributions declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. As a result of the suspension of the DRIP offering, unless and until our board reinstates the DRIP offering, stockholders who are current participants in the DRIP will be paid distributions in cash.
Share Repurchase Plan
Our share repurchase plan allowed for repurchases of shares of our common stock by us when certain criteria were met. Share repurchases were made at the sole discretion of our board. On November 14, 2022, our board suspended our share repurchase plan beginning with share repurchase requests for the quarter ending December 31, 2022. All share repurchase requests, including requests resulting from the death or qualifying disability of stockholders, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2022, will not be processed, will be considered canceled in full and will not be considered outstanding repurchase requests.
We did
no
t repurchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased

Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity
Membership Interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings
As of December 31, 2023, Trilogy REIT Holdings owned approximately
97.5
% of Trilogy. We were the indirect owner of a
76.0
% interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings pursuant to an amended joint venture agreement with an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc., or NHI. We serve as the managing member of Trilogy REIT Holdings. As of December 31, 2023, NHI indirectly owned a
24.0
% membership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings, and as such, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
24.0
% of the net earnings of Trilogy REIT Holdings were allocated to noncontrolling interests.
On November 3, 2023, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or the MIPA, with subsidiaries of NHI, which provided us with the option to purchase their
24.0
% minority membership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings. On September 20, 2024, using the net proceeds from the September 2024 Offering, we exercised our option to purchase all of the
24.0
% minority membership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings that was owned by NHI, for a total all-cash purchase price of  $
258,001,000
. Such purchase price reflects a “base” purchase price of $
247,000,000
and a supplemental payment of approximately $
11,001,000
relating to NHI’s pro-rata share of Trilogy REIT Holdings’ budgeted distributions to its members during the pre-exercise period relative to NHI’s actual distributions received during that period. In connection with such purchase and as of September 20, 2024, we own
100
% of Trilogy REIT Holdings and indirectly own
100
% of Trilogy. Previously, from January 1, 2024 through September 19, 2024,
24.0
% of the net earnings of Trilogy REIT Holdings were allocated to noncontrolling interests.
Other Noncontrolling Interests
In connection with our acquisition and operation of Trilogy, profit interest units in Trilogy, or the Profit Interests, were issued to Trilogy Management Services, LLC and independent directors of Trilogy, both unaffiliated third parties that manage or direct the day-to-day operations of Trilogy. The Profit Interests consisted of time-based or performance-based commitments. The time-based Profit Interests were measured at their grant date fair value and vested in increments of
20.0
% on each anniversary of the respective grant date over a
five-year
period. We amortized the time-based Profit Interests on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods, which were recorded to general and administrative expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The performance-based Profit Interests were measured at their fair value on the adoption date of ASU 2018-07,
Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting
, using a modified retrospective approach, were subject to a performance commitment and would have vested upon liquidity events as defined in the Profit Interests agreements. The nonvested awards were presented as noncontrolling interests in total equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and were re-classified to redeemable noncontrolling interests upon

vesting as they had redemption features outside of our control, similar to the common stock units held by Trilogy’s management. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, for a further discussion.
In April 2024, we redeemed all the remaining Profit Interests for cash. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, for a further discussion of our redemption of the Profit Interests. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized stock compensation expense related to the time-based Profit Interests of $
0
and $
21,000
, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized stock compensation expense related to the time-based Profit Interests of $
21,000
and $
62,000
, respectively.
As of December 31, 2023, we owned an
86.0
% interest in a consolidated limited liability company that owned Lakeview IN Medical Plaza. On February 6, 2024, we purchased the remaining
14.0
% membership interest in the consolidated limited liability company that owned Lakeview IN Medical Plaza from an unaffiliated third party for a contract purchase price of $
441,000
. In connection with such purchase and as of such date, we own a
100
% interest in such limited liability company. As such, from January 1, 2024 through February 5, 2024, and for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
14.0
% of the net earnings of Lakeview IN Medical Plaza were allocated to noncontrolling interests.
As discussed in Note 1, Organization and Description of Business, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we, through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, owned a
98.5
% and
95.0
%, respectively, general partnership interest in our operating partnership and the remaining
1.5
% and
5.0
%, respectively, OP units in our operating partnership were owned by limited partners. Some of the limited partnership units outstanding, which accounted for approximately
1.0
% of our total operating partnership units outstanding as of December 31, 2023, had redemption features outside of our control and were accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interests presented outside of permanent equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the closing of the February 2024 Offering and listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE, such redemption features are no longer outside of our control and we reclassed the remaining carrying amount of such redeemable noncontrolling interests as of such date to noncontrolling interests in total equity. On August 19, 2024, Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC redeemed all of its OP units in exchange for
1,216,571
shares of our Common Stock on a
one
-for-one basis, and as a result, is no longer a limited partner of our operating partnership. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024,
1.5
% of our total operating partnership units outstanding is presented as noncontrolling interests in total equity in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, for a further discussion.
AHR Incentive Plan
Pursuant to our Second Amended and Restated 2015 Incentive Plan, or the AHR Incentive Plan, our board (with respect to options and restricted shares of common stock granted to independent directors) or our compensation committee (with respect to any other award) may grant options, restricted shares of common stock, stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights or other awards to our independent directors, officers, employees and consultants.

Such expense was based on the grant date fair value for time-based awards and for performance-based awards that are probable of vesting, which fair value calculation used the most recently published estimated per share net asset value for awards granted prior to the February 2024 Offering, and the closing market price of our listed Common Stock commencing with awards granted effective as of the February 2024 Offering date. Stock compensation expense is included in general and administrative expenses in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

There were no transfers into and out of fair value measurement levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. The valuation of these instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. Such valuation reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, as well as option volatility. The fair values of our interest rate swaps were determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts were based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves.
We incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.
Although we determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative financial instruments fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with this instrument utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparty. However, as of September 30, 2024, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Financial Instruments Disclosed at Fair Value
Our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, mortgage loans payable and borrowings under our lines of credit and term loan.
We consider the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments based upon an evaluation of the underlying characteristics and market data, in light of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. The fair values of the other financial instruments are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of our debt security investment is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates available to us for investments with similar terms and maturities. The fair values of our mortgage loans payable and our lines of credit and term loan are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using borrowing rates available to us for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities. We have determined that the valuations of our debt security investment, mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan are classified in Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

15. Income Taxes
As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, pursuant to the Code. TRS may participate in services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.
Current Income Tax
Federal and state income taxes are generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRS. Foreign income taxes are generally a function of our income on our real estate located in the United Kingdom, or UK, and Isle of Man.
Deferred Taxes
Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (primarily basis differences between tax and financial reporting for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating loss that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.
We recognize the effects of an uncertain tax position on the financial statements, when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the “more likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any tax benefits or liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established if we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are not realizable. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our valuation allowance fully reserves the net deferred tax assets due to historical losses and inherent uncertainty of future income. We will continue to monitor industry and economic conditions and our ability to generate taxable income based on our business plan and available tax planning strategies, which would allow us to utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets and thereby allow us to reverse all, or a portion of, our valuation allowance in the future.

Lessee
We lease certain land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, campus and office equipment and automobiles. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend at various dates through 2107, excluding extension options. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.
The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically based on the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index and may also include other variable lease costs (i.e., common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance). Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

17. Segment Reporting
We evaluate our business and make resource allocations based on
four
reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM (which was formerly known as medical office buildings, or MOBs), SHOP and triple-net leased properties.
Prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we evaluated our business and made resource allocations based on
six
reportable business segments. All segment information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been recast for all periods presented to reflect
four
reportable business segments and the change in segment name from MOBs to OM. The segment name change from MOBs to OM did not result in any changes to the composition of such segment or information reviewed by management, and therefore, had no impact on the historical results of operations.
Our OM buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our triple-net leased properties segment includes senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital investments, which are single-tenant properties for which we lease the properties to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all property operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our triple-net leased properties segment includes our debt security investment. Our SHOP segment includes

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) — (Continued)
senior housing, which may provide assisted living care, independent living, memory care or skilled nursing services, that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.
While we believe that net income or loss, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement, our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of our combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, primarily based on net operating income, or NOI, for each segment. We define segment NOI as total revenues and grant income, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, interest expense, gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interests, foreign currency gain or loss, other income or expense and income tax benefit or expense for each segment. We believe that segment NOI serves as an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. Non-segment assets primarily consist of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, deferred financing costs and other assets not attributable to individual properties.

18. Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution.
Based on leases as of September 30, 2024, properties in
three
states in the United States accounted for
10.0
% or more of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI, which is based on contractual base rent from leases in effect for our non-RIDEA properties and annualized NOI for our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses as of September 30, 2024. Properties located in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky accounted for
28.7
%,
12.5
% and
12.3
%, respectively, of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each state’s economy.
Based on leases in effect as of September 30, 2024, our integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties segments accounted for
55.8
%,
23.4
%,
11.3
% and
9.5
%, respectively, of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. As of September 30, 2024,
no
ne of our tenants at our properties accounted for
10.0
% or more of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI.

19. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited OP units are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
2,933,361
and
3,311,054
limited OP units, respectively, and for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
3,501,976
limited OP units, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The use of the words “we,” “us” or “our” refers to American Healthcare REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, except where otherwise noted.
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to promote understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. Such discussion is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 22, 2024. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and information have been prepared to reflect our financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, together with our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our results of operations and financial condition, as reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, are subject to management’s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions, changing capital market conditions, and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants and residents. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we modified how we evaluate our business and make resource allocations, and therefore determined that we operate through four reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, outpatient medical, or OM, (which was formerly known as medical office buildings, or MOBs), triple-net leased properties and senior housing operating properties, or SHOP. All segment information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been recast for all periods presented to reflect four reportable business segments and the change in segment name from MOBs to OM. The segment name change from MOBs to OM did not result in any changes to the composition of such segment or information reviewed by management, and therefore, had no impact on the historical results of operations.

Overview and Background
American Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed REIT that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on outpatient medical buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, and other healthcare-related facilities. We have built a fully-integrated management platform, with approximately 114 employees, that operates clinical healthcare properties throughout the United States, the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. We operate our integrated senior health campuses and SHOP utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure. We have also originated and acquired secured loans and may originate or acquire other real estate-related investments in the future on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.
Operating Partnership
We conduct substantially all of our operations through American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership, and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of December 31, 2023
,
we owned 95.0% of the operating partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining 5.0% OP units were owned by the following limited partners: AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Mathieu B. Streiff, one of our directors; Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC; Flaherty Trust; and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC. On August 19, 2024, Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC redeemed all of its OP units in exchange for 1,216,571 shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and as a result, is no longer a limited partner of our operating partnership. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 98.5% of the OP units in our operating partnership, and the remaining 1.5% of the OP units were owned by the remaining limited partners. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 13, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.
Public Offerings and Listing
We issued an aggregate 65,445,557 shares of Class T common stock and Class I common stock, for a total of $2,737,716,000 in gross offering proceeds, since February 26, 2014 in our initial public offerings and our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, offerings. Our initial public offerings were terminated as of April 2019.
On February 9, 2024, pursuant to a Registration Statement filed with the SEC on Form S-11 (File No. 333-267464), as amended, we closed our underwritten public offering, or the February 2024 Offering, through which we issued 64,400,000 shares of Common Stock, for a total of $772,800,000 in gross offering proceeds. Such amounts include the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional 8,400,000 shares of Common Stock. These shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the trading symbol “AHR” and began trading on February 7, 2024.
Following the closing of the February 2024 Offering and until August 5, 2024, we presented Common Stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock, or collectively, common stock, as separate classes within our condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of equity. Any references to “Common Stock” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to our NYSE-listed shares sold through the February 2024 Offering or the September 2024 Offering, as defined below, whereas Class T common stock and Class I common stock refer to classes of common stock that were not listed. This applies to all historical periods presented herein. On August 5, 2024, 180 days after the listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE, each share of our Class T common stock and Class I common stock automatically converted into one share of our listed Common Stock.
On September 20, 2024, we closed our additional underwritten public offering, or the September 2024 Offering, under a prospectus supplement and related prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to our effective shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-281488). Through the September 2024 Offering, we issued 20,010,000 shares of Common Stock, for a total of $471,236,000 in gross offering proceeds. Such amounts include the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional 2,610,000 shares of Common Stock. These shares are listed on NYSE under the trading symbol “AHR” and began trading on September 19, 2024.
See Note 13, Equity, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, for a further discussion of our public offerings.

Our Real Estate Investments Portfolio
We currently operate through four reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. As of September 30, 2024, we owned and/or operated 324 buildings and integrated senior health campuses, representing approximately 19,676,000 square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, for an aggregate contract purchase price of $4,666,399,000. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we also owned a real estate-related debt investment purchased for $60,429,000.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying footnotes. These estimates are made and evaluated on an ongoing basis using information that is currently available, as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. The complete listing of our Critical Accounting Estimates was previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024, and there have been no material changes to our Critical Accounting Estimates as disclosed therein, except as included within Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Interim Unaudited Financial Data
For a discussion of interim unaudited financial data, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Interim Unaudited Financial Data, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.
Acquisitions and Dispositions in 2024
For a discussion of our acquisitions and dispositions of investments in 2024, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Properties Held for Sale, Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net, and Note 4, Business Combinations, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Factors Which May Influence Results of Operations
Other than the effects of inflation discussed below, as well as other national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, and as otherwise disclosed in our risk factors, we are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact, favorable or unfavorable, on revenues or income from the acquisition, disposition, management and operation of our properties. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results or performance, see “Forward-Looking Statements” above and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those Risk Factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.
Inflation
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, inflation has affected our operations. The annual rate of inflation in the United States was 2.4% in September 2024 and 3.7% in September 2023, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. We believe inflation has impacted our operations such that we have experienced, and continue to experience, increases in the cost of labor, services, energy and supplies, and therefore continued inflationary pressures on our integrated senior health campuses and SHOP could continue to impact our profitability in future periods. To offset the impact of inflation on the cost of labor and services, we had our RIDEA managers bill higher than average annual rent and care fee increases for existing residents in 2023 and 2024, as compared to prior years, while adjusting market rates as frequently as needed based on competitor pricing and market conditions. We believe this practice will improve operating performance in our integrated senior health campuses and SHOP, as well as increase rent coverage and the stability of our real estate revenue in our triple-net leased properties over time.
For properties that are not operated under a RIDEA structure, there are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that help us mitigate the impact of inflation. These provisions include negotiated rental increases, which historically range from 2% to 3% per year, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges and real estate tax and insurance reimbursements. However, due to the long-term nature of existing leases, among other factors, the leases may not reset frequently enough to cover inflation.

Table of Contents
In addition, inflation has also caused an increase in the cost of our variable-rate debt due to historically rising interest rates. See
Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.
Scheduled Lease Expirations
Excluding our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses, as of September 30, 2024, our properties were 91.0% leased, and, during the remainder of 2024, 2.8% of the leased GLA is scheduled to expire. Our leasing strategy focuses on negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the next twelve months. In the future, if we are unable to negotiate renewals, we will try to identify new tenants or collaborate with existing tenants who are seeking additional space to occupy. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining weighted average lease term was 6.5 years, excluding our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses.
Our combined SHOP and integrated senior health campuses were 87.8% leased as of September 30, 2024. Substantially all of our leases with residents at such properties are for a term of one year or less.
Results of Operations
Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
Our operating results are primarily comprised of income derived from our portfolio of properties and expenses in connection with the acquisition and operation of such properties. Our primary sources of revenue include rent generated by our leased, non-RIDEA properties and resident fees and services revenue from our RIDEA properties. Our primary expenses include property operating expenses and rental expenses. In general, we expect such revenues and expenses related to our portfolio of RIDEA properties to increase in the future due to an overall increase in occupancies, resident fees and pricing of care services provided.
We segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management reviews our performance and makes operating decisions. As of September 30, 2024, we operated through four reportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties.
The most significant drivers behind changes in our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023 were primarily due to: the increase in resident occupancies and billing rates, partially offset by the adverse effect of inflation, which resulted in increases in the cost of labor, services, energy and supplies; our acquisitions and dispositions of investments subsequent to September 30, 2023; and the transition of the operations of certain leased senior housing and skilled nursing facilities from triple-net leased properties to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure. Additional information behind the changes in our consolidated results of operations is discussed in more detail below. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Properties Held for Sale, Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net, and Note 4, Business Combinations, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our acquisitions and dispositions during 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we owned and/or operated the following types of properties (dollars in thousands):

Revenues and Grant Income
Our primary sources of revenue include resident fees and services revenue generated by our RIDEA properties and rent from our leased, non-RIDEA properties. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, resident fees and services revenue primarily consisted of rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary services, and real estate revenue primarily consisted of base rent and expense recoveries. The amount of revenues generated by our RIDEA properties depends principally on our ability to maintain resident occupancy rates. The amount of revenues generated by our non-RIDEA properties is dependent on our ability to maintain tenant occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease available space at the then existing rental rates. We also received grant income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues and grant income by reportable segment consisted of the following for the periods then ended (in thousands):

Resident Fees and Services Revenue
For our integrated senior health campuses segment, we increased resident fees and services revenue by $37,335,000 and $99,605,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: (i) increased resident occupancy and higher resident fees as a result of an increase in billing rates and levels of service; and (ii) an increase of $8,320,000 and $18,357,000, respectively, due to the expansion of our customer base, expansion of services offered and increases in billing rates for such services at ancillary business units within Trilogy Investors, LLC, or Trilogy.
For our SHOP segment, resident fees and services revenue increased $23,293,000 and $51,902,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to: (i) an increase of $11,893,000 and $31,418,000, respectively, due to the acquisition of 14 senior housing properties in February 2024; (ii) an increase of $4,028,000 and $12,367,000, respectively, due to the transitioning of leased senior housing facilities in our Michigan ALF Portfolio to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in November 2023; and (iii) an increase of $1,581,000 due to the acquisition of five senior housing properties in Washington in September 2024. Additionally, $5,102,000 of the increase in resident fees and services revenue for our SHOP segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to transitioning SNFs in our Central Wisconsin Senior Care Portfolio from triple-net leased properties to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in March 2023. The remaining increase in resident fees and services revenue for our SHOP segment was primarily attributable to increased resident occupancy and higher resident fees as a result of an increase in billing rates and levels of service. Such increases were partially offset by real estate dispositions within our SHOP segment in 2023 and 2024.

Real Estate Revenue
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, real estate revenue within our triple-net leased properties segment increased $1,983,000, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the transitioning of the senior housing facilities in our Michigan ALF Portfolio to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in 2023 that resulted in the full amortization of $2,756,000 of above-market leases recorded against real estate revenue in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, real estate revenue within our triple-net leased properties segment increased $8,176,000, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to transitioning each of the leased SNFs in our Central Wisconsin Senior Care Portfolio and the leased senior housing facilities in our Michigan ALF Portfolio to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in 2023 that resulted in the full amortization of an aggregate $10,829,000 of above-market leases recorded against real estate revenue in the prior year. Such increase was partially offset by a decrease in real estate revenue generated from our Michigan ALF Portfolio prior to such transition to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure.
Real estate revenue for our OM segment decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to dispositions of OM buildings during 2023 and 2024 and a slight decrease in occupancy.
Grant Income
For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not recognize any grant income. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $1,064,000 and $7,445,000, respectively, of grant income at our integrated senior health campuses related to government grants received through certain federal and state pandemic-related relief measures, such as reimbursement programs.
Property Operating Expenses and Rental Expenses
Integrated senior health campuses and SHOP typically have a higher percentage of direct operating expenses to revenue and grant income than OM buildings and triple-net leased properties due to the nature of RIDEA-type facilities where we conduct day-to-day operations. Property operating expenses and property operating expenses as a percentage of resident fees and services revenue and grant income, as well as rental expenses and rental expenses as a percentage of real estate revenue, by reportable segment consisted of the following for the periods then ended (dollars in thousands):

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in total property operating expenses for our integrated senior health campuses segment was predominately due to: (i) increased resident occupancy at the facilities within such segment; and (ii) an increase of $6,574,000 and $22,789,000, respectively, within Trilogy’s ancillary business unit due to higher labor costs associated with the expansion of services offered and inflation’s impact on labor costs and other operating expenses.

Table of Contents
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, total property operating expenses for our SHOP segment increased primarily due to: (i) an increase of $10,666,000 and $27,588,000, respectively, due to the acquisition of 14 senior housing properties in February 2024; (ii) an increase of $4,442,000 and $13,350,000, respectively, due to the transitioning of the senior housing facilities in our Michigan ALF Portfolio from triple-net leased properties to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in November 2023; (iii) an increase of $975,000 due to the acquisition of five senior housing properties in Washington in September 2024; and (iv) increased resident occupancy at the facilities within such segment. Additionally,
$3,900,000 of the increase in total property operating expenses for our SHOP segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to transitioning the SNFs in our Central Wisconsin Senior Care Portfolio from triple-net leased properties to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in March 2023. Such increases in total property operating expenses for our SHOP segment were partially offset by a decrease of $1,134,000 and $14,155,000, respectively, in total property operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to real estate dispositions within our SHOP segment in 2023 and 2024.
Rental expenses for our OM segment decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the dispositions of OM buildings since September 30, 2023.
Business Acquisition Expenses
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded business acquisition expenses of $3,537,000 and $6,334,000, respectively, primarily related to $2,691,000 and $4,926,000, respectively, in aggregate acquisition costs incurred for properties operated under a RIDEA structure and included in our SHOP segment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded business acquisition expenses of $1,024,000 and $2,244,000, respectively, primarily incurred in pursuit of real estate-investment opportunities. See Note 4, Business Combinations, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our senior housing properties acquired in February 2024 and September 2024.
Depreciation and Amortization
For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization was $44,246,000 and $49,273,000, respectively, which primarily consisted of depreciation on our operating properties of $37,610,000 and $36,929,000, respectively, and amortization of our identified intangible assets of $5,958,000 and $11,778,000, respectively. For nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization was $132,277,000 and $138,644,000, respectively, which primarily consisted of depreciation on our operating properties of $111,611,000 and $109,967,000, respectively, and amortization of our identified intangible assets of $18,692,000 and $26,618,000, respectively.
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in depreciation and amortization of $5,027,000 was primarily due to the full amortization of $5,750,000 of in-place leases related to the transition of the senior housing — leased facilities within our Michigan ALF Portfolio to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in depreciation and amortization of $6,367,000 was primarily due to the full amortization of an aggregate $6,635,000 of in-place leases related to the transition of the SNFs within our Central Wisconsin Senior Care Portfolio to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in March 2023 and the transition of the senior housing — leased facilities in our Michigan ALF Portfolio to a managed portfolio utilizing a RIDEA structure in November 2023.

The decrease in total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in debt balances predominately related to: (i) the payoff of $176,145,000 of variable-rate mortgage loans payable and paydown of $545,010,000 on our variable-rate lines of credit in February 2024 from the net proceeds received from the February 2024 Offering; and (ii) the paydown of $194,000,000 on our variable-rate lines of credit in September 2024 from the net proceeds received from the September 2024 Offering. Such decrease in total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was partially offset by the $10,362,000 change from gain to loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments. See Note 7, Other Assets, Net, Note 8, Mortgage Loans Payable, Net, and Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of debt and derivative extinguishments.
Gain or Loss on Dispositions of Real Estate Investments
For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we disposed of a land easement on one of our OM properties and recognized a net loss on sale of $(4,000). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an aggregate net gain on dispositions of our real estate investments of $2,257,000 primarily related to the sale of two OM buildings and one SHOP in 2024. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Properties Held for Sale and Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net — Dispositions of Real Estate Investments, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an aggregate net gain on dispositions of our real estate investments of $31,981,000 primarily related to the sale of one SHOP within our Central Florida Senior Housing Portfolio and three OM buildings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an aggregate net gain on dispositions of our real estate investments of $29,777,000 primarily related to the sale of six SHOP within our Central Florida Senior Housing Portfolio and 14 OM buildings.
Impairment of Real Estate Investments
For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not recognize impairment charges on real estate investments. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $12,510,000 for two of the SHOP within our Northern CA Senior Housing Portfolio. See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net— Impairment of Real Estate Investments, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Gain on Re-measurement of Previously Held Equity Interest
For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not recognize any gain on re-measurement of any previously held equity interest. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a $726,000 gain on re-measurement of the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Memory Care Partners, LLC. See Note 4, Business Combinations, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, borrowings under our lines of credit and proceeds from dispositions of real estate investments. For the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements (including principal and interest); (iii) fund development activities and capital expenditures; and (iv) make distributions to our stockholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. We believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter. We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources.
Material Cash Requirements
Capital Improvement Expenditures
A capital plan for each investment is established upon acquisition that contemplates the estimated capital needs of that investment, including costs of refurbishment, tenant improvements or other major capital expenditures. The capital plan also sets forth the anticipated sources of the necessary capital, which may include operating cash generated by the investment, capital reserves, a line of credit or other loan established with respect to the investment, other borrowings or additional equity investments from us and joint venture partners. The capital plan for each investment is adjusted through ongoing, regular reviews of our portfolio or as necessary to respond to unanticipated additional capital needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had $16,297,000 of restricted cash in loan impounds and reserve accounts to fund a portion of such capital expenditures. Based on the budget for the properties we owned as of September 30, 2024, we estimated that unspent discretionary expenditures for capital and tenant improvements as of such date are to be approximately $14,686,000 for the remaining three months of 2024, although actual expenditures are dependent on many factors which are not presently known.
Contractual Obligations
The following table provides information with respect to: (i) the maturity and scheduled principal repayment of our secured mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan; (ii) interest payments on our mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan, excluding the effect of our interest rate swaps; (iii) ground and other lease obligations; and (iv) financing and other obligations as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Credit Facilities
We are party to a credit agreement, as amended, with an aggregate maximum principal amount up to $1,150,000,000, or the 2024 Credit Facility. In addition, we are party to an agreement, as amended, regarding a senior secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount of $400,000,000, or the Trilogy Credit Facility. See Note 9, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion.
As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facility and the Trilogy Credit Facility was $1,550,000,000. As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities was $596,532,000, and we had an aggregate of $953,468,000 available on such facilities. We believe that the resources described above will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next 12 months and thereafter.

The following summary discussion of our changes in our cash flows is based on our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
Operating Activities
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash flows from operating activities were primarily related to property operations, offset by payments of general and administrative expenses and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness. In general, cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of cash receipts and payments. In addition, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by the increase in operating performance of our real estate investments in our integrated senior health campuses and SHOP segments, as well as a decrease in interest paid on our outstanding indebtedness as a result of mortgage payoffs and paydowns on our lines of credit using net proceeds from the February 2024 Offering and September 2024 Offering. See the “Results of Operations” section above for further discussion.
Investing Activities
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change from net cash provided by investing activities to net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $153,332,000 decrease in proceeds from dispositions of real estate investments, partially offset by a $12,000,000 decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities, a $12,130,000 decrease in developments and capital expenditures and a $17,508,000 change from issuance of real estate notes receivable to net principal repayments on real estate notes receivable.
Financing Activities
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change from net cash used in financing activities to net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the closing of the February 2024 Offering and September 2024 Offering that resulted in an aggregate $1,244,036,000 in gross offering proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock as well as a decrease of $15,042,000 in net payments on financing and other obligations. Such amounts were partially offset by a $761,587,000 increase in net payments on our lines of credit and mortgage loans payable, primarily using the net proceeds from the February 2024 Offering and September 2024 Offering for such paydowns, $258,001,000 in cash paid to purchase the noncontrolling interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings LLC held by a joint venture partner, a $69,023,000 increase in payment of offering costs, a $22,906,000 increase in distributions paid to common stockholders and a $20,129,000 increase in cash paid to redeem certain equity interests owned in Trilogy Investors, LLC.

Distributions
Our board shall authorize distributions, if any, on a quarterly basis, in such amounts as our board shall determine, and each quarterly record date for the purposes of such distributions shall be determined and authorized by our board in the last month of each calendar quarter until such time as our board changes our distribution policy. On November 14, 2022, our board suspended our DRIP offering beginning with distributions declared, if any, for the quarter ending December 31, 2022. As a result of the suspension of our DRIP, unless and until our board reinstates our DRIP offering, stockholders who are current participants in our DRIP were or will be paid distributions in cash.
Since the first quarter of 2023, our board has authorized a quarterly distribution equal to $0.25 per share to holders of our common stock, which we expect will continue to be paid in the future, though we cannot guarantee that our distributions will continue at the current value. Such quarterly distributions were equal to an annualized distribution rate of $1.00 per share and paid in cash, only from legally available funds. The amount of the quarterly distributions paid to our common stockholders was determined by our board and was dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code.
The following tables reflect distributions we paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the sources of distributions as compared to cash flows from operations or funds from operations attributable to controlling interest, or FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure (dollars in thousands):

REIT Requirements
In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute to our stockholders a minimum of 90.0% of our REIT taxable income.
Existin
g Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, guidance includes a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly offered REITs ca
n satisfy the distribution requirement by distributing a combination of cash and stock to stockholders. In general, to qualify under the safe harbor, each stockholder must elect to receive either cash or stock, and the aggregate cash component of the distribution to stockholders must represent at least
20.0%
of the total distribution
. In the event that there is a shortfall in net cash available due to factors including, without limitation, the timing of such distributions or the timing of the collection of receivables, we may seek to obtain capital to make distributions by means of secured and unsecured debt financing through one or more unaffiliated third parties. We may also make distributions with cash from capital transactions including, without limitation, the sale of one or more of our properties.
Commitments and Contingencies
For a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Debt Service Requirements
A significant liquidity need is the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1,307,702,000 of fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgage loans payable outstanding secured by our properties. As of September 30, 2024, we had $596,532,000 outstanding, and $953,468,000 remained available under our lines of credit. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt, factoring in our interest rate swaps, was 4.72% per annum as of September 30, 2024. See Note 8, Mortgage Loans Payable, Net, and Note 9, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
We are required by the terms of certain loan documents to meet various financial and non-financial covenants, such as leverage ratios, net worth ratios, debt service coverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants and requirements on our mortgage loans payable and our lines of credit and term loan. If any future covenants are violated, we anticipate seeking a waiver or amending the debt covenants with the lenders when and if such event should occur. However, there can be no assurances that management will be able to effectively achieve such plans.
Funds from Operations and Normalized Funds from Operations
Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of funds from operations is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure, and our management uses FFO to evaluate our performance over time. FFO is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP.
We define FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on funds from operations approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, or the White Paper. The White Paper defines funds from operations as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT’s policy described above.
Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our operating performance to investors, industry analysts and our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss).
We define normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest, or Normalized FFO, as FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): expensed acquisition fees and costs, which we refer

However, FFO and Normalized FFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance, GAAP cash flows from operations as an indicator of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and Normalized FFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and Normalized FFO. Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors, industry analysts and management as they compare the operating performance used by the REIT industry, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate funds from operations and normalized funds from operations the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and Normalized FFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. None of the SEC, NAREIT, or any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or Normalized FFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT, or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or Normalized FFO.
The following is a reconciliation of net income or loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO and Normalized FFO for the periods presented below (in thousands):

Net Operating Income
Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interests, foreign currency gain or loss, other income or expense and income tax benefit or expense.
NOI is not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity. NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss). NOI should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance.
We believe that NOI is an appropriate supplemental performance measure to reflect the performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the operations of the properties. We believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community and is useful to investors in understanding the profitability and operating performance of our property portfolio. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.
To facilitate understanding of this financial measure, the following is a reconciliation of net income or loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to NOI for the periods presented below (in thousands):

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business plan, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures, or in the methods we use to manage market risk, from those that were provided for in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire and develop properties and other investments. Our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate increases on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs while taking into account variable interest rate risk. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow or lend at fixed or variable rates.
56
Table of Contents
We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We have not elected, and may continue to not elect, to apply hedge accounting treatment to these derivatives; therefore, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative financial instruments were recorded as a component of interest expense in gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of September 30, 2024, our interest rate swaps are recorded in other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at their aggregate fair value of $3,088,000. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. For information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
As of September 30, 2024, the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes, excluding the effect of our interest rate swaps (dollars in thousands):

Debt Security Investment, Net
As of September 30, 2024, the net carrying value of our debt security investment was $90,144,000. As we expect to hold our debt security investment to maturity and the amounts due under such debt security investment are limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our debt security investment, would have a significant impact on our operations. See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value of our investment in a held-to-maturity debt security. The effective interest rate on our debt security investment was 4.24% per annum as of September 30, 2024.
Mortgage Loans Payable, Net and Lines of Credit and Term Loan
Mortgage loans payable were $1,307,702,000 ($1,282,853,000, net of discount/premium and deferred financing costs) as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 97 fixed-rate mortgage loans payable and three variable-rate mortgage loans payable with effective interest rates ranging from 2.21% to 8.20% per annum and a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.28%. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had $596,532,000 ($591,490,000, net of deferred financing fees) outstanding under our lines of credit and term loan, at a weighted average interest rate of 6.39% per annum.
As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt, factoring in our interest rate swaps, was 4.72% per annum. An increase in the variable interest rate on our variable-rate mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan constitutes a market risk. As of September 30, 2024, a 0.50% increase in the market rates of interest would have increased our overall annualized interest expense on all of our other variable-rate mortgage loans payable and lines of credit by $1,070,000, or 1.2% of total annualized interest expense on our mortgage loans payable and lines of credit and term loan. See Note 8, Mortgage Loans Payable, Net, and Note 9, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Other Market Risk
In addition to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the value of our future investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants and residents, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
(a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs.
As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
(b)
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
For a discussion of our legal proceedings, see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation, to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
There were no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024, other than as set forth below.
Our high concentrations of properties in particular geographic areas magnify the effects of negative conditions affecting those geographic areas.
We have a concentration of properties in particular geographic areas; therefore, any adverse situation that disproportionately effects one of those areas would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, properties located in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky accounted for approximately 28.7%, 12.5% and 12.3%, respectively, of our total property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each such state’s economy, real estate and other market conditions.
Compliance with new federal minimum staffing requirements may increase operating costs for our skilled nursing tenants and operators, and failure to comply with such requirements may result in financial or other regulatory penalties or reputational harm.
In April 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services finalized new nursing home staffing rules, including a total nurse staffing standard that requires facilities to provide a minimum number of hours per day of total direct nursing care to residents and a requirement to have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to provide skilled nursing care. These new requirements have a staggered implementation timeframe based on geographic location. As these new rules are implemented over time, the operating costs of our skilled nursing tenants within our triple-net leased properties segment, as well as our SNF operations within our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses segments, may increase, which will negatively impact the profitability of both our tenants’ businesses and our business. Our skilled nursing tenants and operators may also have difficulty in staffing and maintaining the required staffing at our facilities, and may not qualify for the specified hardship exemptions. If we or our tenants are unable to comply with the new rules, we may face monetary penalties or other regulatory enforcement action as well as reputational harm.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
On August 19, 2024, Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC redeemed all of its OP units in exchange for 1,216,571 shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. The issuance of shares of Common Stock was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
None.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.
Not applicable.
Item 5. Other Information.
During the period covered by this report, none of our directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) has
adopted
or
terminated
a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
