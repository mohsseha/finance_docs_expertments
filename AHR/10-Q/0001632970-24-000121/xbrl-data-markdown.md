| Basis Of Accounting Policy Policy Text Block | Interim Unaudited Financial DataOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full-year results may be less favorable. | c-1 |  |
| Business Combination Disclosure Text Block | 4. Business CombinationsOn February 1, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of14senior housing properties in Oregon from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in our SHOP segment. These properties are part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment, as defined and described in Note 5. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $94,461,000at the time of acquisition. No cash consideration was exchanged as part of the transaction; however, we incurred transaction costs of $2,636,000related to the acquisition of such properties. See Note 5, Debt Security Investment, Net, for a further discussion.On September 3, 2024, we acquired a portfolio offivesenior housing properties in Washington from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in our SHOP segment. These properties are also part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $36,178,000at the time of acquisition. No cash consideration was exchanged as part of the transaction; however, we incurred transaction costs of $2,904,000related to the acquisition of such properties. See Note 5, Debt Security Investment, Net, for a further discussion.On February 15, 2023, we, through Trilogy, acquired from an unaffiliated third party, a60.0% controlling interest in a privately held company, Memory Care Partners, LLC, or MCP, that operated integrated senior health campuses located in Kentucky. The contract purchase price for the acquisition of MCP was $900,000, which was acquired using cash on hand. Prior to such acquisition, we owned a40.0% interest in MCP, which was accounted for as an equity method investment and was included in investments in unconsolidated entities within other assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in MCP, we now own a100% controlling interest in MCP. As a result, we re-measured the fair value of our previously held equity interest in MCP and recognized a gain on re-measurement of $726,000in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.Based on quantitative and qualitative considerations, such business combinations were not material to us individually or in the aggregate and therefore, pro forma financial information is not provided. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminary estimates at acquisition.Any necessary adjustments are finalized within one year from the date of acquisition.The table below summarizes the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of our business combinations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):2024Acquisitions2023AcquisitionBuilding and improvements$90,531$—Land19,006—In-place leases17,717—Goodwill—3,331Furniture, fixtures and equipment—39Cash and restricted cash—565Accounts receivable343—Other assets17566Total assets acquired127,7724,001Mortgage loans payable (including debt discount of $3,385)(127,254)—Accounts payable and accrued liabilities(518)(1,676)Financing obligations—(12)Security deposits and other liabilities—(812)Total liabilities assumed(127,772)(2,500)Net assets acquired$—$1,501 | c-1 |  |

| Commitments And Contingencies Disclosure Text Block | 11. Commitments and ContingenciesLitigationWe are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which, if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. | c-1 |  |
| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | 18. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution.Based on leases as of September 30, 2024, properties inthreestates in the United States accounted for10.0% or more of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI, which is based on contractual base rent from leases in effect for our non-RIDEA properties and annualized NOI for our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses as of September 30, 2024. Properties located in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky accounted for28.7%,12.5% and12.3%, respectively, of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each state’s economy. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control will own substantially all of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owned a98.5% and95.0%, respectively, general partnership interest therein, and the remaining1.5% and5.0%, respectively, partnership interest was owned by limited partners. | c-1 |  |

| Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities Disclosure Text Block | 10. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We recorded such derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability, as applicable, measured at fair value.The following table lists the derivative financial instruments held by us as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which were included in other assets and other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (dollars in thousands):Fair ValueInstrumentNotionalAmountIndexInterest RateEffective DateMaturity DateSeptember 30,2024December 31,2023Swap$275,000One MonthTerm SOFR3.74%02/01/2301/19/26$(361)$1,463Swap$275,000One MonthTerm SOFR4.41%08/08/2301/19/26(2,727)(2,178)Swap$200,000One MonthTerm SOFR4.40%01/05/2406/05/25—(211)$(3,088)$(926)As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. On September 20, 2024, we terminatedoneinterest rate swap that would have matured on June 5, 2025 and had a notional amount of $200,000,000. We paid a fee of $415,000related to such contract termination, which is recorded as loss on the early extinguishment of derivatives and included as an increase to interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a net (loss) gain in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $(8,967,000) and $3,402,000, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a net (loss) gain in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $(2,162,000) and $8,200,000, respectively, as a (increase)/decrease to total interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the change in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.See Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments. | c-1 |  |

| Earnings Per Share Text Block | 19. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited OP units are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,2,933,361and3,311,054limited OP units, respectively, and for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,3,501,976limited OP units, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,1,092,886and186,868nonvested RSAs, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,969,889and185,193nonvested RSAs, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such restricted stock awards were anti-dilutive during these periods. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,341,098and163,058nonvested TBUs, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,286,314and113,987nonvested TBUs, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such restricted stock awards were anti-dilutive during these periods.For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,309,254and70,751nonvested PBUs, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,236,137and56,800nonvested PBUs, respectively, were treated as contingently issuable shares pursuant to ASC Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation. Such contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they were antidilutive during the period. | c-1 |  |

| Financing Receivable Allowance For Credit Losses Policy For Uncollectible Amounts | Resident and Tenant Receivables and AllowancesResident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | 15. Income TaxesAs a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, pursuant to the Code. TRS may participate in services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.Current Income TaxFederal and state income taxes are generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRS. Foreign income taxes are generally a function of our income on our real estate located in the United Kingdom, or UK, and Isle of Man.Deferred TaxesDeferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (primarily basis differences between tax and financial reporting for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating loss that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.We recognize the effects of an uncertain tax position on the financial statements, when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the “more likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any tax benefits or liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established if we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are not realizable. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our valuation allowance fully reserves the net deferred tax assets due to historical losses and inherent uncertainty of future income. We will continue to monitor industry and economic conditions and our ability to generate taxable income based on our business plan and available tax planning strategies, which would allow us to utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets and thereby allow us to reverse all, or a portion of, our valuation allowance in the future. | c-1 |  |

| Investments In Debt And Marketable Equity Securities And Certain Trading Assets Disclosure Text Block | 5. Debt Security Investment, NetOur investment in a commercial mortgage-backed debt security, or debt security, bears an interest rate on the stated principal amount thereof equal to4.24% per annum, the terms of which security provide for monthly interest-only payments. The debt security matures on August 25, 2025 at an aggregate stated amount of $93,433,000, resulting in an anticipated yield-to-maturity of10.0% per annum. The debt security was issued by an unaffiliated mortgage trust and represents a10.0% beneficial ownership interest in such mortgage trust. The debt security is subordinate to all other interests in the mortgage trust and is not guaranteed by a government-sponsored entity.On February 1, 2024 and September 3, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of14senior housing properties in Oregon and a portfolio offivesenior housing properties in Washington, respectively, from unaffiliated third parties, which properties are included in the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. We did not grant any concessions to such borrower, and the carrying value of our debt security investment at the time of acquisition did not exceed the fair value of such properties. See Note 4, Business Combinations, for a further discussion of such acquisitions.As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the debt security investment was $90,144,000and $86,935,000, respectively, net of unamortized closing costs of $251,000and $489,000, respectively. Accretion on the debt security for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,168,000and $1,060,000, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $3,447,000and $3,126,000, respectively, which is recorded as an increase to real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Amortization expense of closing costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $82,000and $71,000, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $238,000and $204,000, respectively, which is recorded as a decrease to real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

| Nature Of Operations | 1. Organization and Description of BusinessOverview and BackgroundAmerican Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on outpatient medical buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, and other healthcare-related facilities. We have built a fully-integrated management platform that operates clinical healthcare properties throughout the United States, the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. We operate our integrated senior health campuses and senior housing operating properties, or SHOP, utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure. We have also originated and acquired secured loans and may originate or acquire other real estate-related investments in the future on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.Operating PartnershipWe conduct substantially all of our operations through American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership, and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of December 31, 2023,we owned95.0% of the operating partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining5.0% OP units were owned by the following limited partners: AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Mathieu B. Streiff, one of our directors; Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC; Flaherty Trust; and a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC. On August 19, 2024, Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC redeemed all of its OP units in exchange for1,216,571shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and as a result, is no longer a limited partner of our operating partnership. As of September 30, 2024, we owned98.5% of the OP units in our operating partnership, and the remaining1.5% of the OP units were owned by the remaining limited partners. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 13, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.Public Offerings and ListingWe issued an aggregate65,445,557shares of Class T common stock and Class I common stock, for a total of $2,737,716,000in gross offering proceeds, since February 26, 2014 in our initial public offerings and our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, offerings. Our initial public offerings were terminated as of April 2019.On February 9, 2024, pursuant to a Registration Statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on Form S-11 (File No. 333-267464), as amended, we closed our underwritten public offering, or the February 2024 Offering, through which we issued64,400,000shares of Common Stock, for a total of $772,800,000in gross offering proceeds. Such amounts include the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional8,400,000shares of Common Stock. These shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the trading symbol “AHR” and began trading on February 7, 2024.Following the closing of the February 2024 Offering and until August 5, 2024, we presented Common Stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock, or collectively, common stock, as separate classes within our condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of equity. Any references to “Common Stock” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to our NYSE-listed shares sold through the February 2024 Offering or the September 2024 Offering, as defined below, whereas Class T common stock and Class I common stock refer to our classes of common stock that were not NYSE-listed. This applies to all historical periods presented herein. On August 5, 2024, 180 days after the listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE, each share of our Class T common stock and Class I common stock automatically converted into one share of our listed Common Stock. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | 17. Segment ReportingWe evaluate our business and make resource allocations based onfourreportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM (which was formerly known as medical office buildings, or MOBs), SHOP and triple-net leased properties.Prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we evaluated our business and made resource allocations based onsixreportable business segments. All segment information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been recast for all periods presented to reflectfourreportable business segments and the change in segment name from MOBs to OM. The segment name change from MOBs to OM did not result in any changes to the composition of such segment or information reviewed by management, and therefore, had no impact on the historical results of operations.Our OM buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our triple-net leased properties segment includes senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital investments, which are single-tenant properties for which we lease the properties to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all property operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our triple-net leased properties segment includes our debt security investment. Our SHOP segment includes | c-1 |  |

| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control will own substantially all of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owned a98.5% and95.0%, respectively, general partnership interest therein, and the remaining1.5% and5.0%, respectively, partnership interest was owned by limited partners.The accounts of our operating partnership are consolidated in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements because we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and have unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions (even if additional limited partners are admitted to our operating partnership). All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.Interim Unaudited Financial DataOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full-year results may be less favorable. | c-1 |  |

| Use Of Estimates | Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the initial and recurring valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed through property acquisitions including through business combinations, goodwill and its impairment, revenues and grant income, allowance for credit losses, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and contingencies. These estimates are made and evaluated on an ongoing basis using information that is currently available, as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. | c-1 |  |
