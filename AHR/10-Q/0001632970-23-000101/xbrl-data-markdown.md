| Basis Of Accounting Policy Policy Text Block | Interim Unaudited Financial DataOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full year results may be less favorable. | c-1 |  |
| City Area Code | 949 | c-1 |  |
| Commitments And Contingencies Disclosure Text Block | 10. Commitments and ContingenciesLitigationWe are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Environmental MattersWe follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.OtherOur other commitments and contingencies include the usual obligations of real estate owners and operators in the normal course of business, which include calls/puts to sell/acquire properties. In our view, these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. | c-1 |  |
| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | 17. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been and are prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2023, the 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility, as defined in Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, for our consolidated subsidiary of which we indirectly own approximately74.0%, has an outstanding balance of approximately $367,000,000and matures in less than 12 months on September 5, 2024. The 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility is secured by28of our integrated senior health campuses and is non-recourse to us. We also do not guarantee the 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility for any nonperformance of the principal or interest payments. Management plans to refinance the outstanding balance prior to its maturity. Management also believes that given the current value of these campuses relative to the current outstanding balance of the 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility, it is probable such loan could be refinanced under current lending conditions to extend the maturity date beyond 12 months from the filing date of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. | c-1 |  |

| Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities Disclosure Text Block | 9. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable-rate term loan pursuant to our 2022 Credit Facility and we record such derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. We didnot have any derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2022.The following table provides information with respect to the derivative financial instruments held by us as of September 30, 2023, which were included in other assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet (dollars in thousands):InstrumentNotional AmountIndexInterest RateEffective DateMaturity DateFair ValueSeptember 30, 2023Swap$275,000one monthTerm SOFR3.74%02/01/2301/19/26$6,125Swap275,000one monthTerm SOFR4.41%08/08/2301/19/262,075$550,000$8,200As of September 30, 2023, our derivative financial instruments were not designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements.

| Earnings Per Share Text Block | 18. Per Share DataBasic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $963,000and $1,497,000for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $2,851,000and $4,485,000for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were186,868and223,064nonvested shares, respectively, of our RSAs outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of both September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were3,501,976limited partnership units of our operating partnership outstanding, but such units were also excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were159,678and19,200nonvested time-based restricted stock units outstanding, respectively, but such units were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such restricted stock units were anti-dilutive during the period.As of September 30, 2023, there were70,751nonvested performance-based restricted stock units outstanding, which were treated as contingently issuable shares pursuant to ASC Topic 718,Compensation — Stock Compensation. Such contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they were anti-dilutive during the period. | c-1 |  |

Fair Value MeasurementsAssets and Liabilities Reported at Fair ValueThe table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (in thousands):Quoted Prices inActive Markets forIdentical Assetsand Liabilities(Level 1)Significant OtherObservable Inputs(Level 2)SignificantUnobservable Inputs(Level 3)TotalAssets:Derivative financial instruments$—$8,200$—$8,200Total assets at fair value$—$8,200$—$8,200There were no transfers into and out of fair value measurement levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. We did not have any assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022.Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We also previously used interest rate swaps or interest rate caps to manage such interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. Such valuation reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, as well as option volatility. The fair values of our interest rate swaps were determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts were based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves.We incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.Although we determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative financial instruments fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with this instrument utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparty. However, as of September 30, 2023, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. On January 25, 2022, our prior interest rate swap contracts matured and as of December 31, 2022, we did not have any derivative financial instruments.Financial Instruments Disclosed at Fair ValueOur accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets include the following financial instruments: debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, mortgage loans payable and borrowings under our lines of credit and term loan.We consider the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities to approximate the fair value for these financial instruments based upon an evaluation of the underlying characteristics, market data and because of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. | c-1 |  |

| Financing Receivable Allowance For Credit Losses Policy For Uncollectible Amounts | Resident and Tenant Receivables and AllowancesResident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | 14. Income TaxesAs a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, pursuant to the Code. TRS may participate in services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.Current Income TaxFederal and state income taxes are generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRS. Foreign income taxes are generally a function of our income on our real estate located in the United Kingdom, or UK, and Isle of Man.Deferred TaxesDeferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (primarily basis differences between tax and financial reporting for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating loss that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.We recognize the financial statement effects of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the “more likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority. As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we did not have any tax benefits or liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established if we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are not realizable. As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our valuation allowance fully reserves the net deferred tax assets due to historical losses and inherent uncertainty of future income. We will continue to monitor industry and economic conditions, and our ability to generate taxable income based on our business plan and available tax planning strategies, which would allow us to utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets and thereby allow us to reverse all, or a portion of, our valuation allowance in the future. | c-1 |  |

Lines of Credit and Term Loan2022 Credit FacilityOnJanuary 19, 2022, we, through our operating partnership, as borrower, and certain of our subsidiaries, or the subsidiary guarantors, collectively as guarantors, entered into an agreement, or the 2022 Credit Agreement, to amend and restate the credit agreement for our existing credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America, KeyBank National Association, Citizens Bank, National Association, and the lenders named therein. The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount up to $1,050,000,000,or the 2022 Credit Facility, which consists of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate amount of$500,000,000and a senior unsecured term loan facility in the initial aggregate amount of$550,000,000. The proceeds of loans made under the 2022 Credit Facility may be used for refinancing existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes including for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes not inconsistent with obligations under the 2022 Credit Agreement. We may also obtain up to $25,000,000inthe form of standby letters of credit pursuant to the 2022 Credit Facility. Unless defined herein, all capitalized terms under this “2022 Credit Facility” subsection are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement.Under the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, the revolving loans mature on January 19, 2026, and may be extended forone12-month period, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. The term loan matures on January 19, 2027, and may not be extended. The maximum principal amount of the 2022 Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate incremental amount of $700,000,000, subject to: (i) the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement; and (ii) at leastfivebusiness days’ prior written notice to Bank of America.The 2022 Credit Facility bears interest at varying rates based upon, at our option, (i) Daily SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Daily SOFR Rate Loans or (ii) the Term SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans. If, under the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, there is an inability to determine the Daily SOFR or the Term SOFR then the 2022 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans. The loans may be repaid in whole or in part without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.The 2022 Credit Agreement requires us to add additional subsidiaries as guarantors in the event the value of the assets owned by the subsidiary guarantors falls below a certain threshold as set forth in the 2022 Credit Agreement. In the event of default, Bank of America has the right to terminate the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions under the 2022 Credit Agreement, and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and interest thereon. On March 1, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the 2022 Credit Agreement, or the First Amendment. The material terms of the First Amendment provided for revisions to certain financial covenants for a limited period of time. Except as modified by the terms of the First Amendment, the material terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement remain in full force and effect. | c-1 |  |

| Nature Of Operations | 1. Organization and Description of BusinessOverview and BackgroundAmerican Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, or MOBs, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, hospitals and other healthcare-related facilities. We also operate healthcare-related facilities utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). Our healthcare facilities operated under a RIDEA structure include our senior housing operating properties, or SHOP, and our integrated senior health campuses. We have originated and acquired secured loans and may also originate and acquire other real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.On October 1, 2021, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., or GAHR III, merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub, of Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., or GAHR IV, with Merger Sub being the surviving company, which we refer to as the REIT Merger, and our operating partnership, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, merged with and into Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, or the Surviving Partnership, with the Surviving Partnership being the surviving entity, which we refer to as the Partnership Merger and, together with the REIT Merger, the Merger. Following the Merger on October 1, 2021, our company was renamed American Healthcare REIT, Inc. and the Surviving Partnership was renamed American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership.Also on October 1, 2021, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, and pursuant to a contribution and exchange agreement dated June 23, 2021, GAHR III acquired a newly formed entity, American Healthcare Opps Holdings, LLC, or NewCo, which we refer to as the AHI Acquisition. Following the Merger and the AHI Acquisition, our company became self-managed.Operating PartnershipWe conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,we owned95.0% of the partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining5.0% limited OP units, were owned by AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mathieu B. Streiff, one of our directors; Platform Healthcare Investor TII, LLC; Flaherty Trust; and a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC, or collectively, the NewCo Sellers. See Note 11, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 12, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.Public OfferingsAs of September 30, 2023, after taking into consideration the impact of the Merger and the reverse stock split as discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we had issued65,445,557shares for a total of $2,737,716,000of common stock since February 26, 2014 in our initial public offerings and our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, offerings (includes historical offering amounts sold by GAHR III and GAHR IV prior to the Merger).On September 16, 2022, we filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-267464), which was last amended on November 7, 2023 upon filing with the SEC Amendment No. 2 to Registration Statement on Form S-11, with respect to a proposed public offering by us of our shares of common stock in conjunction with a contemplated listing of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or the Proposed Listing.

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standard Update, or ASU, 2020-04,Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform of Financial Reporting, or ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria. ASU 2020-04 applies to the aforementioned transactions that reference the London Inter-bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01,Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), or ASU 2021-01, which clarifies that certain optional expedients and exceptions for contract modification and hedge accounting apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of the discontinuation of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate due to reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06,Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, or ASU 2022-06, which extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance under ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. ASU 2020-04, ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after March 12, 2020 and through the effective date December 31, 2024, as extended by ASU 2022-06. We adopted such accounting pronouncements on January 1, 2023, which has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures as of September 30, 2023.In July 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120, SEC Staff Announcement at the March 24, 2022 EITF Meeting, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 6.B, Accounting Series Release 280-General Revision of Regulation S-X: Income or Loss Applicable to Common Stock,or ASU 2023-03. ASU 2023-03 amends the Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, for SEC updates pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120; SEC Staff Announcement at the March 24, 2022 Emerging Issues Task Force Meeting; and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 6.B, Accounting Series Release 280 - General Revision of Regulation S-X: Income or Loss Applicable to Common Stock. These updates were immediately effective and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05,Business Combinations — Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805- 60): Recognition and Initial Measurement,or ASU 2023-05. ASU 2023-05 applies to the initial formation of a “joint venture” or a “corporate joint venture” as defined in the accounting literature and requires a joint venture to apply a new basis of accounting by initially measuring and recognizing all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. In particular, a joint venture will measure its total assets and liabilities upon formation as the fair value of the joint venture as a whole, which would equal the fair value of all of the joint venture’s outstanding equity interests. The new guidance does not change the definition of a joint venture, the accounting by the investors for their investments in a joint venture (e.g., equity method accounting) or the accounting by a joint venture for contributions received after its formation. ASU 2023-05 will be applied prospectively and is effective for all newly-formed joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-05 on January 1, 2025 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | 16. Segment ReportingAs of September 30, 2023, we evaluated our business and made resource allocations based onsixreportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, MOBs, SHOP, SNFs, senior housing — leased and hospitals.Our MOBs are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our senior housing — leased and skilled nursing facilities are single-tenant properties for which we lease the facilities to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all facility operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our senior housing — leased segment includes our debt security investment. Our hospital investments are similarly structured to our leased skilled nursing and senior housing facilities. Our SHOP segment includes senior housing facilities, which may provide assisted living care, independent living, memory care or skilled nursing services, that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.While we believe that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement, we evaluate our segments’ performance based upon segment net operating income or loss, or NOI. We define segment NOI as total revenues and grant income, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, impairment of goodwill, foreign currency gain or loss, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interests, other income and income tax benefit or expense for each segment. We believe that segment NOI serves as an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. Non-segment assets primarily consist of corporate assets including cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, deferred financing costs and other assets not attributable to individual properties. | c-1 |  |

| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been and are prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2023, the 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility, as defined in Note 8, Lines of Credit and Term Loan, for our consolidated subsidiary of which we indirectly own approximately74.0%, has an outstanding balance of approximately $367,000,000and matures in less than 12 months on September 5, 2024. The 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility is secured by28of our integrated senior health campuses and is non-recourse to us. We also do not guarantee the 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility for any nonperformance of the principal or interest payments. Management plans to refinance the outstanding balance prior to its maturity. Management also believes that given the current value of these campuses relative to the current outstanding balance of the 2019 Trilogy Credit Facility, it is probable such loan could be refinanced under current lending conditions to extend the maturity date beyond 12 months from the filing date of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. | c-1 |  |
| Stockholders Equity Note Disclosure Text Block | 12. EquityPreferred StockPursuant to our charter, we are authorized to issue200,000,000shares of our preferred stock, par value $0.01per share. As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,noshares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding.Common StockPursuant to our charter, as amended, we are authorized to issue1,000,000,000shares of our common stock, par value $0.01per share, whereby200,000,000shares are classified as Class T common stock and800,000,000shares are classified as Class I common stock. As of September 30, 2023, after taking into consideration the Merger and the impact of the reverse stock split as discussed below, we had issued65,445,557shares for a total of $2,737,716,000of common stock since February 26, 2014 in our initial public offerings and DRIP offerings (includes historical offering amounts sold by GAHR III and GAHR IV prior to the Merger).

| Subsequent Events Text Block | 19. Subsequent EventOption to Acquire Minority Joint Venture Partner’s Membership Interest in Trilogy REIT HoldingsOn November 3, 2023, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or the MIPA, with subsidiaries of NHI, which provides us with the option to purchase their24.0% minority membership interest in Trilogy REIT Holdings. If we exercise this purchase option, we will own100% of Trilogy REIT Holdings, which (assuming that there are no changes in the equity capitalization of Trilogy prior to consummation of the purchase) will in turn cause us to indirectly own approximately97.4% of Trilogy. Subject to our first satisfying certain closing conditions, the option is exercisable for a closing before September 30, 2025 assuming that we exercise both extension options described below. If we exercise our purchase option, the all cash purchase price would be $240,500,000if we consummate the purchase on or before March 31, 2024, would increase to $247,000,000if we consummate the purchase from April 1, 2024 to and including December 31, 2024 and would further increase to $260,000,000if we consummate the purchase on or after January 1, 2025. | c-1 |  |
| Use Of Estimates | Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the initial and recurring valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed through property acquisitions, including through business combinations, goodwill and its impairment, revenues and grant income, allowance for credit losses, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and contingencies. These estimates are made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. | c-1 |  |
