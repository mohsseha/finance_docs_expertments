| Basis Of Accounting Policy Policy Text Block | Interim Unaudited Financial DataOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full-year results may be less favorable. | c-1 |  |

| Commitments And Contingencies Disclosure Text Block | 10. Commitments and ContingenciesLitigationWe are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which, if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Environmental MattersWe follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency. | c-1 |  |
| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | 17. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution.Based on leases as of March 31, 2024, properties intwostates in the United States accounted for10.0% or more of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI, which is based on contractual base rent from leases in effect for our non-RIDEA properties and annualized NOI for our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses as of March 31, 2024. Properties located in Indiana and Ohio accounted for33.2% and13.9%, respectively, of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each state’s economy. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control will own substantially all of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owned a97.4% and95.0%, respectively, general partnership interest therein, and the remaining2.6% and5.0%, respectively, limited partnership interest was owned by the Limited Partners. | c-1 |  |

| Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities Disclosure Text Block | 9. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We recorded such derivative financial instruments in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability, as applicable, measured at fair value.The following table lists the derivative financial instruments held by us as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which were included in other assets and other liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets (dollars in thousands):Fair ValueInstrumentNotionalAmountIndexInterest RateEffective DateMaturity DateMarch 31, 2024December 31, 2023Swap$275,000One MonthTerm SOFR3.74%02/01/2301/19/26$3,868$1,463Swap275,000One MonthTerm SOFR4.41%08/08/2301/19/26642(2,178)Swap200,000One MonthTerm SOFR4.40%01/05/2406/05/25981(211)$750,000$5,491$(926)As of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a net gain (loss) in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $6,417,000and ($195,000), respectively, as a decrease (increase) to total interest expense in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the change in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments.See Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments. | c-1 |  |

| Earnings Per Share Text Block | 18. Per Share DataBasic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $1,095,000and $926,000for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, there were1,118,215and184,145nonvested shares, respectively, of our RSAs outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such shares were | c-1 |  |

The valuation of these instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. Such valuation reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, as well as option volatility. The fair values of our interest rate swaps were determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts were based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves.We incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.Although we determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative financial instruments fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with this instrument utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparty. However, as of March 31, 2024, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. | c-1 |  |

| Financing Receivable Allowance For Credit Losses Policy For Uncollectible Amounts | Resident and Tenant Receivables and AllowancesResident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | 14. Income TaxesAs a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our consolidated subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, pursuant to the Code. TRS may participate in services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs and are subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate tax rates.Current Income TaxFederal and state income taxes are generally a function of the level of income recognized by our TRS. Foreign income taxes are generally a function of our income on our real estate located in the United Kingdom, or UK, and Isle of Man.Deferred TaxesDeferred income tax is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (primarily basis differences between tax and financial reporting for real estate assets and equity investments) and generation of tax net operating loss that may be realized in future periods depending on sufficient taxable income.We recognize the effects of an uncertain tax position on the financial statements, when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the tax position, that such a position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. If the tax benefit meets the “more likely than not” threshold, the measurement of the tax benefit will be based on our estimate of the ultimate tax benefit to be sustained if audited by the taxing authority. As of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any tax benefits or liabilities for uncertain tax positions that we believe should be recognized in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. | c-1 |  |

| Investments In Debt And Marketable Equity Securities And Certain Trading Assets Disclosure Text Block | 4. Debt Security Investment, NetOur investment in a commercial mortgage-backed debt security, or debt security, bears an interest rate on the stated principal amount thereof equal to4.24% per annum, the terms of which security provide for monthly interest-only payments. The debt security matures on August 25, 2025 at an aggregate stated amount of $93,433,000, resulting in an anticipated yield-to-maturity of10.0% per annum. The debt security was issued by an unaffiliated mortgage trust and represents a10.0% beneficial ownership interest in such mortgage trust. The debt security is subordinate to all other interests in the mortgage trust and is not guaranteed by a government-sponsored entity.On February 1, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of14senior housing properties in Oregon from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. We did not grant any concessions to such borrower, and the carrying value of our debt security investment at the time of acquisition did not exceed the fair value of such properties. See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net and Business Combinations, for a further discussion of such acquisition.As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the debt security investment was $87,984,000and $86,935,000, respectively, net of unamortized closing costs of $413,000and $489,000, respectively. Accretion on the debt security for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $1,125,000and $1,020,000, respectively, which is recorded as an increase to real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Amortization expense of closing costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $76,000and $65,000, respectively, which is recorded as a decrease to real estate revenue in our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We evaluated credit quality indicators such as the agency ratings and the underlying collateral of such investment in order to determine expected future credit loss. No credit loss was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. | c-1 |  |

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $46,008,000and $42,303,000, respectively, of revenues related to operating lease payments, of which $9,659,000and $10,040,000, respectively, was for variable lease payments.As of March 31, 2024, the following table sets forth the undiscounted cash flows for future minimum base rents due under operating leases for the remaining nine months ending December 31, 2024 and for each of the next four years ending December 31 and thereafter for properties that we wholly own (in thousands):YearAmount2024$101,8272025127,2112026117,4872027111,7452028100,456Thereafter486,642Total$1,045,368LesseeWe lease certain land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, campus and office equipment and automobiles. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend at various dates through 2107, excluding extension options.

| Nature Of Operations | 1. Organization and Description of BusinessOverview and BackgroundAmerican Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on outpatient medical buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, and other healthcare-related facilities. We also operate healthcare-related facilities utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). Our healthcare facilities operated under a RIDEA structure include our senior housing operating properties, or SHOP, and our integrated senior health campuses. We have originated and acquired secured loans and may also originate and acquire other real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.Operating PartnershipWe conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership, and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,we owned97.4% and95.0%, respectively, of the partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining2.6% and5.0%, respectively, limited OP units were owned by AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T.

See Note 11, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 12, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.Public Offerings and ListingWe issued an aggregate65,445,557shares of Class T common stock and Class I common stock, for a total of $2,737,716,000in gross offering proceeds, since February 26, 2014 in our initial public offerings and our distribution reinvestment plan, or DRIP, offerings. Our initial public offerings were terminated as of April 2019.On February 9, 2024, pursuant to a Registration Statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on Form S-11 (File No. 333-267464), as amended, we closed our underwritten public offering, or the 2024 Offering, through which we issued64,400,000shares of Common Stock, for a total of $772,800,000in gross offering proceeds. Such amounts include the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional8,400,000shares of Common Stock. These shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the trading symbol “AHR” and began trading on February 7, 2024.Following the closing of the 2024 Offering, we are presenting Common Stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock, or collectively, common stock, as separate classes within our condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of equity.

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2023-07,Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,or ASU 2023-07, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. Such disclosure amendments include the requirement for public entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,or ASU 2023-09, which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules,The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. The final rules require a registrant to disclose, among other things: material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks, as well as a quantitative and qualitative description of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that directly result from such mitigation or adaptation activities; material capitalized costs, expenses and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions; information about the registrant’s board of directors’ oversight of climate-related risks and management’s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant’s business, results of operations or financial condition. The rules require registrants to provide such climate-related disclosures in their annual reports, beginning with annual reports for the year ending December 31, 2025 for calendar-year-end large accelerated filers. In April 2024, the SEC stayed the final rules in response to legal challenges to the rules. As a result, it is not clear whether current compliance deadlines will be extended once the litigation is resolved. We are currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact to our consolidated financial statement disclosures. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | 16. Segment ReportingWe evaluate our business and make resource allocations based onfourreportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM (which was formerly known as medical office buildings, or MOBs), SHOP and triple-net leased properties.Prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we evaluated our business and made resource allocations based onsixreportable business segments. All segment information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been recast for all periods presented to reflectfourreportable business segments and the change in segment name from MOBs to OM. The segment name change from MOBs to OM did not result in any changes to the composition of such segment or information reviewed by management, and therefore, had no impact on the historical results of operations.Our OM buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our triple-net leased properties segment includes senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital investments, which are single-tenant properties for which we lease the properties to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all property operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our triple-net leased properties segment includes our debt security investment. Our SHOP segment includes senior housing, which may provide assisted living care, independent living, memory care or skilled nursing services, that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.While we believe that net income or loss, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement, our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of our combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, primarily based on net operating income, or NOI, for each segment. We define segment NOI as total revenues and grant income, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency gain or loss, other income and income tax benefit or expense for each segment. We believe that segment NOI serves as an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. Non-segment assets primarily consist of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, deferred financing costs and other assets not attributable to individual properties. | c-1 |  |

| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Such condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.Basis of PresentationOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control will own substantially all of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership, and as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owned a97.4% and95.0%, respectively, general partnership interest therein, and the remaining2.6% and5.0%, respectively, limited partnership interest was owned by the Limited Partners.The accounts of our operating partnership are consolidated in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements because we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and have unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions (even if additional limited partners are admitted to our operating partnership). All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.Interim Unaudited Financial DataOur accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us in accordance with GAAP in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in our view, of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim period. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year; such full-year results may be less favorable.In preparing our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, management has evaluated subsequent events through the financial statement issuance date. We believe that although the disclosures contained herein are adequate to prevent the information presented from being misleading, our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024. | c-1 |  |

| Use Of Estimates | Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the initial and recurring valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed through property acquisitions including through business combinations, goodwill and its impairment, revenues and grant income, allowance for credit losses, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and contingencies. These estimates are made and evaluated on an ongoing basis using information that is currently available, as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. | c-1 |  |
