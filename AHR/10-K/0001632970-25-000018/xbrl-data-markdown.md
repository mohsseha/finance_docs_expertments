| Business Combination Disclosure Text Block | 4. Business Combinations2024 Business CombinationsOn February 1, 2024, we acquired a portfolio of14senior housing properties in Oregon from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in our SHOP segment. These properties are part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment, as defined and described in Note 5, Debt Security Investment, Net. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $94,461,000at the time of acquisition. No cash consideration was exchanged as part of the transaction; however, we incurred transaction costs of $2,636,000related to the acquisition of such properties. See Note 5 for a further discussion.On September 3, 2024, we acquired a portfolio offivesenior housing properties in Washington from an unaffiliated third party, which properties are included in our SHOP segment. These properties are also part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment. We acquired such properties by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers since such borrower was in default. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $36,178,000at the time of acquisition. No cash consideration was exchanged as part of the transaction; however, we incurred transaction costs of $2,904,000related to the acquisition of such properties. See Note 5, for a further discussion.On October 1, 2024, using cash on hand and a borrowing on our line of credit, we completed the acquisition ofoneSHOP building in Georgia from an unaffiliated third party. The contract purchase price of such property was $8,200,000including closing costs of $185,000related to the acquisition of such property.2023 Business CombinationOn February 15, 2023, we, through Trilogy, acquired from an unaffiliated third party, a60.0% controlling interest in a privately held company, Memory Care Partners, LLC, or MCP, that operated integrated senior health campuses located in Kentucky. The contract purchase price for the acquisition of MCP was $900,000, which was acquired using cash on hand. Prior to such acquisition, we owned a40.0% interest in MCP, which was accounted for as an equity method investment and was included in investments in unconsolidated entities within other assets, net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in MCP, we now own a100% controlling interest in MCP. As a result, we re-measured the fair value of our previously held equity interest in MCP and recognized a gain on re-measurement of $726,000in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.2022 Business CombinationsOn January 3, 2022, we, through a majority-owned subsidiary of Trilogy, acquired an integrated senior health campus in Kentucky from an unaffiliated third party. The contract purchase price for such property acquisition was $27,790,000plus immaterial transaction costs. We acquired such property using cash on hand and placed a mortgage loan payable of $20,800,000on the property at the time of acquisition.On April 1, 2022, we, through a majority-owned subsidiary of Trilogy, acquired a50.0% interest in a pharmaceutical business in Florida from an unaffiliated third party and incurred transaction costs of $938,000.

| Commitments And Contingencies Disclosure Text Block | 11. Commitments and ContingenciesLitigationWe are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which, if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Environmental MattersWe follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.Other | c-1 |  |
| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | 19. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution.Based on leases as of December 31, 2024, properties intwostates in the United States accounted for10.0% or more of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI, which is based on contractual base rent from leases in effect for our non-RIDEA properties and annualized NOI for our SHOP and integrated senior health campuses as of December 31, 2024. Properties located in Indiana and Ohio accounted for35.6% and11.8%, respectively, of our total consolidated property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each state’s economy. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Basis of PresentationOur accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance. | c-1 |  |

| Credit Loss Financial Instrument Policy Text Block | Resident and Tenant Receivables and AllowancesResident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Cybersecurity Risk Process For Informing Board Committee Or Subcommittee Responsible For Oversight Text Block | The Audit Committee's responsibilities include reviewing cybersecurity strategies with management, assessing processes and controls pertaining to the management of our information technology operations and their effectiveness and making sure that management's response to potential cybersecurity incidents is timely and effective. At least annually, the Audit Committee reviews with the management team our cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. This review may cover a variety of relevant topics, potentially including recent developments, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-party and independent reviews, the threat environment, technological trends and information security considerations related to our operators, managers and other third-party partners. The scope and focus of each review are determined based on current priorities and emerging issues in cybersecurity. In addition, we engage third-party consultants to test our IT control effectiveness throughout the year, and any known exceptions and test results are communicated to management and the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. | c-1 |  |

| Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities Disclosure Text Block | 10. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We recorded such derivative financial instruments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability, as applicable, measured at fair value.The following table lists the derivative financial instruments held by us as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which were included in other assets and other liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets (dollars in thousands):Fair ValueDecember 31,InstrumentNotionalAmountIndexInterest RateEffective DateMaturity Date20242023Swap$275,000One MonthTerm SOFR3.74%02/01/2301/19/26$1,013$1,463Swap$275,000One MonthTerm SOFR4.41%08/08/2301/19/26(909)(2,178)Swap$200,000One MonthTerm SOFR4.40%01/05/2406/05/25—(211)$104$(926)As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. On September 20, 2024, we terminatedoneinterest rate swap that would have matured on June 5, 2025 and had a notional amount of $200,000,000. We paid a fee of $415,000related to such contract termination, which is recorded as loss on the early extinguishment of derivatives and included as an increase to interest expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

| Derivatives Policy Text Block | Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes in the normal course of business. We seek to mitigate these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the occasional use of derivatives. Our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts, such as fixed-rate interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.Derivatives are recognized as either other assets or other liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value. We do not designate our derivative instruments as hedge instruments as defined by guidance under ASC Topic 815,Derivatives and Hedges, or ASC Topic 815, which allows for gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges to be offset by the change in value of the hedged items or to be deferred in other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of interest expense in gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Earnings Per Share Text Block | 20. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited OP units are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,2,004,216,3,501,976and3,501,976limited OP units, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,1,002,153,147,044and183,240nonvested RSAs, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such restricted stock awards were anti-dilutive during these periods.

| Equity Method Investments Policy | We report investments in unconsolidated entities using the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies. Under the equity method, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We generally do not recognize equity method losses when such losses exceed our net equity method investment balance unless we have committed to provide such investee additional financial support or guaranteed its obligations. To the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level, the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity. We have elected to follow the cumulative earnings approach when classifying distributions received from equity method investments in our consolidated statements of cash flows, whereby any distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity earnings will be considered a return on investment and classified in operating activities and any excess distributions would be considered a return of investment and classified in investing activities. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded. | c-1 |  |

Fair Value MeasurementsAssets and Liabilities Reported at Fair ValueThe table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (in thousands):Quoted Prices inActive Markets forIdentical Assetsand Liabilities(Level 1)Significant OtherObservable Inputs(Level 2)SignificantUnobservable Inputs(Level 3)TotalAssets:Derivative financial instrument$—$1,013$—$1,013Total assets at fair value$—$1,013$—$1,013Liabilities:Derivative financial instrument$—$(909)$—$(909)Total liabilities at fair value$—$(909)$—$(909) | c-1 |  |
| Fair Value Measurement Policy Policy Text Block | Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair value of certain assets and liabilities is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, we follow a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of our reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and our reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

| Impairment Or Disposal Of Long Lived Assets Including Intangible Assets Policy Policy Text Block | Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible AssetsWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate that we carry at our historical cost less accumulated depreciation, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. We consider the following indicators, among others, in our evaluation of impairment:•significant negative industry or economic trends;•a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; and•a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used or significant physical change in the asset.If indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. In performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. We adjust the net book value of properties we lease to others and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than carrying value. We recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination. Determining the fair value of real estate assets when measuring impairments involves significant judgment and generally utilizes comparable market transactions, negotiations with prospective buyers, or discounted future cash flow analyses subject to the capitalization and growth rates and other assumptions discussed above, as well the application of market discount rates to such cash flows. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows, and estimate fair values, impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.We test indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if indicators arise. We first assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood that the fair value of the reporting group is less than its carrying value. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are usually determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.If impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, then we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare the estimated fair value to the intangible asset’s carrying value. For all of our reporting units, we recognize any shortfall from carrying value as an impairment loss in the current period. | c-1 |  |

| Income Tax Policy Text Block | Income TaxesWe qualify, and elect to be taxed, as a REIT under the Code, and we intend to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute to our stockholders a minimum of 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if we distribute 100% of our taxable income each year to our stockholders.If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we will then be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.We may be subject to certain state and local income taxes on our income, property or net worth in some jurisdictions, and, in certain circumstances, we may also be subject to federal excise taxes on undistributed income. In addition, certain activities that we undertake are conducted by subsidiaries, which we elected to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, to allow us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs. Also, we have real estate investments in the UK and Isle of Man, which do not accord REIT status to United States REITs under their tax laws. Accordingly, we recognize an income tax benefit or expense for the federal, state and local income taxes incurred by our TRS and foreign income taxes on our real estate investments in the UK and Isle of Man.We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets reflect the impact of the future deductibility of operating loss carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in income tax benefit or expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss when such changes occur. Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is recorded in income tax benefit or expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

The lease liability is calculated by using either the implicit rate of the lease or the incremental borrowing rate. The accretion of lease liabilities and amortization expense on right-of-use assets for our operating leases are included in rental expenses, property operating expenses or general and administrative expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

| Nature Of Operations | 1. Organization and Description of BusinessOverview and BackgroundAmerican Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on outpatient medical buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, and other healthcare-related facilities. We have built a fully-integrated management platform that operates clinical healthcare properties throughout the United States, the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man. We own and operate our integrated senior health campuses and senior housing operating properties, or SHOP, utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure. We have also originated and acquired secured loans and may acquire other real estate-related investments in the future on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.On October 1, 2021, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., or GAHR III, merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub, of Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., or GAHR IV, with Merger Sub being the surviving company, which we refer to as the REIT Merger, and our operating partnership, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, merged with and into Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, or the Surviving Partnership, with the Surviving Partnership being the surviving entity, which we refer to as the Partnership Merger and, together with the REIT Merger, the Merger. Following the Merger on October 1, 2021, our company was renamed American Healthcare REIT, Inc. and the Surviving Partnership was renamed American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership.Also on October 1, 2021, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, GAHR III acquired a newly formed entity, American Healthcare Opps Holdings, LLC, which we refer to as the AHI Acquisition, pursuant to a contribution and exchange agreement dated June 23, 2021. Following the Merger and the AHI Acquisition, our company became self-managed.Operating PartnershipWe conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership, and we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership. As of December 31, 2023, we owned95.0% of the operating partnership units, or OP units, in our operating partnership, and the remaining5.0% OP units were owned by the following limited partners: (i) AHI Group Holdings, LLC, which is owned and controlled by Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Mathieu B. Streiff, one of our non-executive directors; (ii) Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC; (iii) Flaherty Trust; and (iv) a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC, or Griffin Capital. On August 19, 2024 and October 18, 2024, Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC and Flaherty Trust, respectively, redeemed all of their OP units in exchange for1,216,571shares and211,306shares, respectively, of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis and, as a result, are no longer limited partners of our operating partnership. On December 6, 2024, Griffin Capital redeemed a portion of its OP units in exchange69,882shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. As of December 31, 2024, we owned98.7% of the OP units in our operating partnership, and the remaining1.3% of the OP units were owned by the remaining limited partners. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, and Note 13, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion of the ownership in our operating partnership.Public Offerings and ListingOn February 9, 2024, pursuant to a Registration Statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on Form S-11 (File No. 333-267464), as amended, we closed our underwritten public offering, or the February 2024 Offering, through which we issued64,400,000shares of Common Stock, for a total of $772,800,000in gross offering proceeds. Such amounts include the exercise in full of the underwriters’ overallotment option to purchase up to an additional8,400,000shares of Common Stock.

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standard Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standard Update, or ASU, 2023-05,Business Combinations — Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805- 60): Recognition and Initial Measurement,or ASU 2023-05. ASU 2023-05 applies to the initial formation of a “joint venture” or a “corporate joint venture” as defined in the accounting literature and requires a joint venture to apply a new basis of accounting by initially measuring and recognizing all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. In particular, a joint venture will measure its total assets and liabilities upon formation as the fair value of the joint venture as a whole, which would equal the fair value of all of the joint venture’s outstanding equity interests. The new guidance does not change the definition of a joint venture, the accounting by the investors for their investments in a joint venture (e.g., equity method accounting) or the accounting by a joint venture for contributions received after its formation. ASU 2023-05 is applied prospectively and is effective for all newly-formed joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted ASU 2023-05 on January 1, 2025, which did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,or ASU 2023-07, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. Such disclosure amendments include the requirement for public entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We adopted ASU 2023-07 beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We provided additional disclosures with regard to our significant segment expenses in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, and no other changes to our consolidated financial statements are required as a result of such adoption.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,or ASU 2023-09, which includes amendments that further enhance income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. We expect to include additional tax disclosures in the notes to our financial statements upon our adoption of ASU 2023-09 beginning with our 2025 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and no other changes to our existing disclosures or consolidated financial statements are expected to result from the adoption of such standard.In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. The final rules require a registrant to disclose, among other things: material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks, as well as a quantitative and qualitative description of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that directly result from such mitigation or adaptation activities; material capitalized costs, expenses and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions; information about the registrant’s board of directors’ oversight of climate-related risks and management’s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant’s business, results of operations or financial condition. The rules require registrants to provide such climate-related disclosures in their annual reports, beginning with annual reports for the year ending December 31, 2025, for calendar-year-end large accelerated filers. In April 2024, the SEC stayed the final rules in response to legal challenges to the rules. The outcome of this | c-1 |  |

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $180,783,000, $185,064,000and $200,526,000, respectively, of revenues related to operating lease payments, of which $36,729,000, $38,415,000, and $39,278,000, respectively, was for variable lease payments.As of December 31, 2024, the following table sets forth the undiscounted cash flows for future minimum base rents due under operating leases for each of the next five years ending December 31 and thereafter for properties that we wholly own (in thousands):YearAmount2025$121,8612026114,4022027108,149202895,945202983,341Thereafter454,817Total$978,515LesseeWe lease certain land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, campus and office equipment and automobiles. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that generally can extend at various dates through 2107, excluding extension options. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically based on the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index and may also include other variable lease costs (i.e., common area maintenance, property taxes and insurance). Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. | c-1 |  |

In February 2024, in connection with the replacement of the 2022 Credit Facility with the 2024 Credit Facility, we incurred an aggregate loss of $565,000on the extinguishment of part of the senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which formed part of the 2022 Credit Facility. Such loss on extinguishment of debt is recorded as an increase to interest expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and was due to the partial write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the senior unsecured revolving credit facility portion of the 2022 Credit Facility. See Note 9 for a further discussion of our lines of credit. Amortization expense on lease inducement for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $351,000and is recorded as a decrease to real estate revenue in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

| Real Estate Depreciation And Amortization Policy Policy Text Block | Real Estate Investments, NetWe carry our operating properties at our historical cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of operating properties includes the cost of land and completed buildings and related improvements, including those related to financing obligations. Expenditures that increase the service life of properties are capitalized and the cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. The cost of buildings and capital improvements is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and capital improvements, up to39years, and the cost for tenant improvements is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life, up to34years. The cost of furniture, fixtures and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful life, up to28years. When depreciable property is retired, replaced or disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings.As part of the leasing process, we may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements. These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term. If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event we are not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease inducement and is included in other assets, net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Lease inducement is amortized over the lease term as a reduction of real estate revenue on a straight-line basis. Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g.,unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process). Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease. Recognition of lease revenue commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements when we are the owner of the leasehold improvements. However, when the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant, the lease inception date (and the date on which recognition of lease revenue commences) is the date the tenant obtains possession of the leased space for purposes of constructing its leasehold improvements. | c-1 |  |

Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we, through our direct and indirect subsidiaries, owned a98.7% and95.0%, respectively, general partnership interest in our operating partnership, and the remaining1.3% and5.0%, respectively, limited partnership interest in our operating partnership was owned by limited partners. Some of the limited partnership units outstanding, which accounted for approximately1.0% of our total operating partnership units outstanding, as of December 31, 2023 had redemption features outside of our control and were accounted for as redeemable noncontrolling interests presented outside of permanent equity in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As a result of the closing of the February 2024 Offering and listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE, such redemption features are no longer outside of our control, and we reclassified the carrying amount of such interests as of such date to noncontrolling interests in total equity in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Further, additional paid-in capital was adjusted to reflect such change in presentation of limited partners interests. See Note 13, Equity — Noncontrolling Interests in Total Equity, for a further discussion.As of December 31, 2023, we, through Trilogy REIT Holdings LLC, or Trilogy REIT Holdings, in which we indirectly held a76.0% ownership interest, owned approximately97.5% of the outstanding equity interests of Trilogy. As of December 31, 2023, certain members of Trilogy’s management and certain members of an advisory committee to Trilogy’s board of directors owned approximately2.5% of the outstanding equity interests of Trilogy. We accounted for such equity interests as redeemable noncontrolling interests or other liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC Topic 480-10-S99-3A, given certain features associated with such equity interests. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we redeemed the equity interests owned by certain members of Trilogy’s management for an aggregate of $17,150,000. As of December 31, 2023, we reclassified the balance of the remaining equity interest owned by such member of Trilogy’s advisory committee from redeemable noncontrolling interest to other liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The Registration Rights Agreement also granted HoldCo (or any successor holder of such shares) demand rights to request additional registration statement filings as well as “piggyback” registration rights, in each case on or after the expiration of the Lock-Up Period. In connection with the Merger, we assumed from GAHR III the Registration Rights Agreement and GAHR III’s obligations thereunder in their entirety. In connection with the 2024 February Offering, the Holders (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) had agreed that, without the prior written consent of the representatives on behalf of the underwriters of the February 2024 Offering, during the period ending 180 days after the date of listing of our common stock for trading on a national securities exchange, they would not, and would not publicly disclose an intention to, directly or indirectly, among others, subject to certain exceptions, exercise their registration rights under the Registration Rights Agreement.

| Revenue From Contract With Customer Policy Text Block | Revenue RecognitionReal Estate RevenueWe recognize real estate revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 842. See the “Leases” section above.Resident Fees and Services RevenueWe recognize resident fees and services revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606. A significant portion of resident fees and services revenue represents healthcare service revenue that is reported at the amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for providing patient care, including ancillary services. These amounts are due from patients, third-party payors (including health insurers and government programs), other healthcare facilities, and others and includes variable consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlement of audits, reviews, and investigations. Generally, we bill the patients, third-party payors and other healthcare facilities several days after the services are performed. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices, any changes to these governmental revenue estimates are recorded in the period the change or adjustment becomes known based on final settlement. Any differences between recorded revenues and subsequent adjustments are reflected in operations in the year finalized.Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided by us. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time is recognized based on actual charges incurred in relation to total expected (or actual) charges. This method provides a depiction of the transfer of services over the term of the performance obligation based on the inputs needed to satisfy the obligation. Generally, performance obligations satisfied over time relate to patients receiving long-term healthcare services, including rehabilitation services. We measure the performance obligation from admission into the facility to the point when we are no longer required to provide services to that patient. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time is recognized when goods or services are provided and we do not believe we are required to provide additional goods or services to the patient. Generally, performance obligations satisfied at a point in time relate to sales of our pharmaceuticals business or to sales of ancillary supplies.Because all of our performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, we have elected to apply the optional exemption provided in ASC Topic 606 and, therefore, are not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed within months of the end of the reporting period.We determine the transaction price based on standard charges for goods and services provided, reduced, where applicable, by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, implicit price concessions provided to uninsured patients, and estimates of goods to be returned. We also determine the estimates of contractual adjustments based on Medicare and Medicaid pricing tables and historical experience. We determine the estimate of implicit price concessions based on the historical collection experience with each class of payor.Agreements with third-party payors typically provide for payments at amounts less than established charges. The following is a summary of the payment arrangements with major third-party payors:•Medicare:Certain healthcare services are paid at prospectively determined rates based on cost-reimbursement methodologies subject to certain limits. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | 18. Segment ReportingOur chief operating decision maker, or CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer and President, evaluates our business and makes resource allocations based onfouroperating segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. These operating segments are also our reportable segments.Our OM buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our triple-net leased properties segment includes senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital investments, which are single-tenant properties for which we lease the properties to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all property operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our triple-net leased properties segment includes our debt security investment. Our SHOP segment includes senior housing, which may provide assisted living care, independent living, memory care or skilled nursing services that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.Our CODM evaluates the performance of our combined properties in each reportable segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, primarily based on net operating income, or NOI, for each segment. NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the operations of our properties. Our CODM also primarily uses NOI for each segment in the annual budget and forecasting process. Further, our CODM considers budget-to-actual variances in NOI on a quarterly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. We define segment NOI as total revenues and grant income, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, interest expense, gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interests, foreign currency gain or loss, other income or expense and income tax benefit or expense for each segment. We believe that segment NOI serves as an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. We also believe that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. Non-segment assets primarily consist of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, deferred financing costs, operating lease right-of-use asset and other assets not attributable to individual properties. | c-1 |  |
| Segment Reporting Policy Policy Text Block | Segment DisclosureWe segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management reviews our performance, evaluates our business and makes operating decisions. Accordingly, we determined that we operate throughfouroperating segments: integrated senior health campuses, OM, SHOP and triple-net leased properties. These operating segments are also our reportable segments. | c-1 |  |

| Use Of Estimates | Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the initial and recurring valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed through property acquisitions including through business combinations, goodwill and its impairment, revenues and grant income, allowance for credit losses, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets and contingencies. These estimates are made and evaluated on an on-going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, perhaps in material adverse ways, and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions. | c-1 |  |
