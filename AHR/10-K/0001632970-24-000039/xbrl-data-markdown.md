| Business Acquisition Pro Forma Information Text Block | The following unaudited pro forma operating information is presented as if the Merger and the AHI Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2020. Such unaudited pro forma information includes a nonrecurring adjustment to present acquisition-related expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2021 in the 2020 pro forma results. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been obtained had the Merger and the AHI Acquisition occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. Unaudited pro forma revenue, net loss and net loss attributable to controlling interest would have been as follows (in thousands):Years Ended December 31,20212020Revenue$1,392,884$1,397,261Net loss$(45,253)$(17,116)Net loss attributable to controlling interest$(35,140)$(20,642) | c-1 |  |
| Business Combination Disclosure Text Block | 4. Business Combinations2023 and 2022 Business CombinationsOn February 15, 2023, we, through a majority-owned subsidiary of Trilogy, acquired from an unaffiliated third party a60.0% controlling interest in a privately held company, Memory Care Partners, LLC, or MCP, that operated integrated senior health campuses located in Kentucky. The contract purchase price for the acquisition of MCP was $900,000, which was acquired using cash on hand. Prior to such acquisition, we owned a40.0% interest in MCP, which was accounted for as an equity method investment and was included in investments in unconsolidated entities within other assets, net in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in MCP, we now own a100% controlling interest in MCP. As a result, we re-measured the fair value of our previously held equity interest in MCP and recognized a gain on re-measurement of $726,000in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.For the year ended December 31, 2022, we accounted forfouracquisitions as business combinations, as discussed below, the firstthreeof which are included within our integrated senior health campuses segment. Based on quantitative and qualitative considerations, suchfourbusiness combinations were not material to us individually or in the aggregate, and, therefore, pro forma financial information is not provided.On January 3, 2022, we, through a majority-owned subsidiary of Trilogy, acquired an integrated senior health campus in Kentucky from an unaffiliated third party. The contract purchase price for such property acquisition was $27,790,000plus immaterial transaction costs. We acquired such property using cash on hand and placed a mortgage loan payable of $20,800,000on the property at the time of acquisition.On April 1, 2022, we, through a majority-owned subsidiary of Trilogy, acquired a50.0% interest in a pharmaceutical business in Florida from an unaffiliated third party and incurred transaction costs of $938,000. Prior to such pharmaceutical business acquisition, we, through a majority-owned subsidiary of Trilogy, owned the other50.0% interest in such business, which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Therefore, through March 31, 2022, our50.0% interest in the net earnings or losses of such unconsolidated entity was included in income or loss from unconsolidated entities in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.On August 1, 2022, we, through a majority-owned subsidiary of Trilogy, acquired a50.0% controlling interest in a privately held company, RHS Partners, LLC, or RHS, that owns and/or operates16integrated senior health campuses located in Indiana, from an unaffiliated third party. The contract purchase price for the acquisition of RHS was $36,661,000plus immaterial closing costs, which was primarily acquired using cash on hand. Prior to such acquisition, we owned a50.0% interest in RHS, which was accounted for as an equity method investment and was included in investments in unconsolidated entities within other assets, net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. Therefore, through July 31, 2022, our50.0% equity interest in the net earnings or losses of RHS was included in income or loss from unconsolidated entities in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in RHS, we now own a100% controlling interest in RHS. As a result, we re-measured the fair value of our previously held equity interest in RHS and recognized a gain on re-measurement of $19,567,000in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.On December 5, 2022, we acquired a portfolio ofsevensenior housing facilities in Texas from an unaffiliated third party, which facilities are included in our SHOP segment. These facilities are part of the underlying collateral pool of real estate assets securing our debt security investment, as defined and described at Note 5, Debt Security Investment, Net. We acquired thesevenfacilities by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers as such borrower was in default on the required debt payments. The aggregated principal balance of such assumed mortgage loans payable was $110,627,000at the time of acquisition.Nocash consideration was exchanged as part of the transactions; however, we incurred transaction costs of $1,895,000related to the acquisition of such facilities. See Note 5, Debt Security Investment, Net, for a further discussion. | c-1 |  |

| Commitments And Contingencies Disclosure Text Block | 11. Commitments and ContingenciesLitigationWe are not presently subject to any material litigation nor, to our knowledge, is any material litigation threatened against us, which, if determined unfavorably to us, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Environmental MattersWe follow a policy of monitoring our properties for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist at our properties, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our properties that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Further, we are not aware of any material environmental liability or any unasserted claim or assessment with respect to an environmental liability that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.Other | c-1 |  |
| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | 19. Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk are primarily our debt security investment, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts and other receivables. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our debt security investment, but we believe collection of the outstanding amount is probable. Cash and cash equivalents are generally invested in investment-grade, short-term instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We have cash and cash equivalents in financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents in excess of FDIC insured limits. We believe this risk is not significant. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable from tenants and residents is limited. We perform credit evaluations of prospective tenants and security deposits are obtained at the time of property acquisition and upon lease execution. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Basis of PresentationOur accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.On November 15, 2022, we effected a one-for-four reverse stock split of our common stock and a corresponding reverse split of the OP units, or the Reverse Splits. All numbers of common shares and per share data, as well as the OP units, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Splits. | c-1 |  |

| Credit Loss Financial Instrument Policy Text Block | Resident and Tenant Receivables and AllowancesResident receivables, which are related to resident fees and services revenue, are carried net of an allowance for credit losses. An allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of residents and payors to meet the contractual obligations under their lease or service agreements. Substantially all of such allowances are recorded as direct reductions of resident fees and services revenue as contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors or implicit price concessions in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our determination of the adequacy of these allowances is based primarily upon evaluations of historical loss experience, the residents’ financial condition, security deposits, cash collection patterns by payor and by state, current economic conditions, future expectations in estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. Tenant receivables, which are related to real estate revenue, and unbilled deferred rent receivables are reduced for amounts where collectability is not probable, which are recognized as direct reductions of real estate revenue in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities Disclosure Text Block | 10. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We recorded such derivative financial instruments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability, as applicable, measured at fair value. We did not have any derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2022.The following table lists the derivative financial instruments held by us as of December 31, 2023, which were included in other assets and other liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets (dollars in thousands):InstrumentNotional AmountIndexInterest RateEffective DateMaturity DateFair ValueDecember 31, 2023Swap$275,000one monthTerm SOFR3.74%02/01/2301/19/26$1,463Swap275,000one monthTerm SOFR4.41%08/08/2301/19/26(2,178)Swap200,000one monthTerm SOFR4.40%01/05/2406/05/25(211)$750,000$(926)As of December 31, 2023,none of our derivative financial instruments were designated as hedges. Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net (loss) gain in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of $(926,000), $500,000and $8,200,000, respectively, as a (increase)/decrease to total interest expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Included in the gain in the fair value of derivative instruments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021 is $823,000related to the fair value of an interest rate swap entered into by GAHR IV, which matured on November 19, 2021.See Note 15, Fair Value Measurements, for a further discussion of the fair value of our derivative financial instruments. | c-1 |  |

| Derivatives Policy Text Block | Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes in the normal course of business. We seek to mitigate these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the occasional use of derivatives. Our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts, such as fixed-rate interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.Derivatives are recognized as either other assets or other liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value. We do not designate our derivative instruments as hedge instruments as defined by guidance under ASC Topic 815,Derivatives and Hedges, or ASC Topic 815, which allows for gains and losses on derivatives designated as hedges to be offset by the change in value of the hedged items or to be deferred in other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments are recorded as a component of interest expense in gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. | c-1 |  |

| Earnings Per Share Text Block | 20. Per Share DataBasic earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented are computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding during the period. Net income (loss) applicable to common stock is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest less distributions allocated to participating securities of $3,803,000, $5,967,000and $1,440,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and all potentially dilutive securities, if any. TBUs, nonvested shares of our RSAs and limited partnership units of our operating partnership are participating securities and give rise to potentially dilutive shares of our common stock.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were147,044and183,240nonvested shares, respectively, of our RSAs outstanding, but such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such shares were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were3,501,976limited partnership units of our operating partnership outstanding, but such units were also excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such units were anti-dilutive during these periods. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were157,329and19,200nonvested TBUs outstanding, respectively, but such units were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because such restricted stock units were anti-dilutive during the period.As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were70,751and29,352nonvested PBUs outstanding, respectively, which were treated as contingently issuable shares pursuant to ASC Topic 718,Compensation — Stock Compensation. Such contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because they were anti-dilutive during the period. | c-1 |  |

Fair Value MeasurementsAssets and Liabilities Reported at Fair ValueThe table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (in thousands):Quoted Prices inActive Markets forIdentical Assetsand Liabilities(Level 1)Significant OtherObservable Inputs(Level 2)SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)TotalAssets:Derivative financial instrument$—$1,463$—$1,463Total assets at fair value$—$1,463$—$1,463Liabilities:Derivative financial instruments$—$2,389$—$2,389Total liabilities at fair value$—$2,389$—$2,389We did not have any assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022. There were no transfers into and out of fair value measurement levels during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.WarrantsAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any warrants outstanding. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we redeemed all the warrants in common units held by certain members of Trilogy’s management for $678,000in cash, and as a result, we did not have any warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Such warrants had redemption features similar to the common units held by members of Trilogy’s management. See Note 12, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests, for a further discussion.Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with variable-rate debt. We also previously used interest rate caps to manage such interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. Such valuation reflected the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, as well as option volatility. The fair values of our interest rate swaps were determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts were based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves.We incorporated credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.Although we determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative financial instruments fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with this instrument utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparty. However, as of December 31, 2023, we assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. On January 25, 2022, our prior interest rate swap contracts matured and as of December 31, 2022, we did not have any derivative financial instruments. | c-1 |  |
| Fair Value Measurement Policy Policy Text Block | Fair Value MeasurementsThe fair value of certain assets and liabilities is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, we follow a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of our reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and our reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. | c-1 |  |

| Foreign Currency Transactions And Translations Policy Text Block | Foreign CurrencyWe have real estate investments in the United Kingdom, or UK, and Isle of Man for which the functional currency is the UK Pound Sterling, or GBP. We translate the results of operations of our foreign real estate investments into United States Dollars, or USD, using the average currency rates of exchange in effect during the period, and we translate assets and liabilities using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity, in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Certain balance sheet items, primarily equity and capital-related accounts, are reflected at the historical currency exchange rates. We also have intercompany notes and payables denominated in GBP with our UK subsidiaries. Gains or losses resulting from remeasuring such intercompany notes and payables into USD at the end of each reporting period are reflected in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When such intercompany notes and payables are deemed to be of a long-term investment nature, they will be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. | c-1 |  |

| Goodwill And Intangible Assets Goodwill Policy | GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of underlying identifiable net assets of a business acquired in a business combination. Our goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We take a qualitative approach, as applicable, to consider whether an impairment of goodwill exists prior to quantitatively determining the fair value of the reporting unit in step one of the impairment test. When step one of the impairment test is utilized, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value in the current period.See Note 4, Business Combinations, for a further discussion of goodwill recognized in connection with our business combinations, and Note 18, Segment Reporting, for a further discussion of goodwill allocation by segment and impairment of goodwill. | c-1 |  |

| Impairment Or Disposal Of Long Lived Assets Including Intangible Assets Policy Policy Text Block | Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible AssetsWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate that we carry at our historical cost less accumulated depreciation, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. We consider the following indicators, among others, in our evaluation of impairment:•significant negative industry or economic trends;•a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; and•a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is used or significant physical change in the asset.If indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. In performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. We adjust the net book value of properties we lease to others and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than carrying value. We recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination. | c-1 |  |

Lines of Credit and Term Loan2022 Credit FacilityOnJanuary 19, 2022, we, through our operating partnership, as borrower, and certain of our subsidiaries, or the subsidiary guarantors, collectively as guarantors, entered into an agreement, or the 2022 Credit Agreement, to amend and restate the credit agreement for our existing credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America, KeyBank National Association, Citizens Bank, National Association, and the lenders named therein. The 2022 Credit Agreement provided for a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount up to$1,050,000,000,or the 2022 Credit Facility, which consisted of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate amount of $500,000,000and a senior unsecured term loan facility in the initial aggregate amount of$550,000,000. The proceeds of loans made under the 2022 Credit Facility could have been used for refinancing existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes including for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes not inconsistent with obligations under the 2022 Credit Agreement. We could have also obtained up to $25,000,000inthe form of standby letters of credit pursuant to the 2022 Credit Facility. Unless defined herein, all capitalized terms under this “2022 Credit Facility” subsection are defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement.Under the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, the revolving loans matured on January 19, 2026, and could have been extended forone12-month period, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. The term loan would have matured on January 19, 2027, and could not be extended. The maximum principal amount of the 2022 Credit Facility could have been increased by an aggregate incremental amount of $700,000,000, subject to: (i) the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement; and (ii) at leastfivebusiness days’ prior written notice to Bank of America.The 2022 Credit Facility bore interest at varying rates based upon, at our option, (i) Daily SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Daily SOFR Rate Loans or (ii) the Term SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans. If, under the terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement, there was an inability to determine the Daily SOFR or the Term SOFR then the 2022 Credit Facility bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans. The loans could have been repaid in whole or in part without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.The 2022 Credit Agreement required us to add additional subsidiaries as guarantors in the event the value of the assets owned by the subsidiary guarantors fell below a certain threshold as set forth in the 2022 Credit Agreement. In the event of default, Bank of America had the right to terminate the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions under the 2022 Credit Agreement, and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and interest thereon. On March 1, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the 2022 Credit Agreement, or the First Amendment. The material terms of the First Amendment provided for revisions to certain financial covenants for a limited period of time. Except as modified by the terms of the First Amendment, the material terms of the 2022 Credit Agreement remained in full force and effect.As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, our aggregate borrowing capacity under the 2022 Credit Facility was $1,050,000,000, excluding the $25,000,000in standby letters of credit described above. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility totaled $914,900,000($914,144,000, net of deferred financing costs related to the senior unsecured term loan facility portion of the 2022 Credit Facility) and $965,900,000($965,060,000, net of deferred financing costs related to the senior unsecured term loan facility portion of the 2022 Credit Facility), respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on such borrowings outstanding was7.08% and6.07% per annum, respectively.

| Nature Of Operations | 1. Organization and Description of BusinessOverview and BackgroundAmerican Healthcare REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that acquires, owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clinical healthcare real estate properties, focusing primarily on outpatient medical buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, and other healthcare-related facilities. We also operate healthcare-related facilities utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). Our healthcare facilities operated under a RIDEA structure include our senior housing operating properties, or SHOP, and our integrated senior health campuses. We have originated and acquired secured loans and may also originate and acquire other real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income; however, we have selectively developed, and may continue to selectively develop, healthcare real estate properties. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code.On October 1, 2021, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., or GAHR III, merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub, of Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., or GAHR IV, with Merger Sub being the surviving company, which we refer to as the REIT Merger, and our operating partnership, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, or GAHR IV Operating Partnership, merged with and into Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, or the Surviving Partnership, with the Surviving Partnership being the surviving entity, which we refer to as the Partnership Merger and, together with the REIT Merger, the Merger. Following the Merger on October 1, 2021, our company, or the Combined Company, was renamed American Healthcare REIT, Inc. and the Surviving Partnership was renamed American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership.Also on October 1, 2021, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, GAHR III acquired a newly formed entity, American Healthcare Opps Holdings, LLC, or NewCo, which we refer to as the AHI Acquisition, pursuant to a contribution and exchange agreement dated June 23, 2021, or the Contribution Agreement, between GAHR III; our operating partnership; American Healthcare Investors, LLC, or AHI; Griffin Capital Company, LLC, or Griffin Capital; Platform Healthcare Investor T-II, LLC; Flaherty Trust; and Jeffrey T. Hanson, the non-executive Chairman of our board of directors, or our board, Danny Prosky, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Mathieu B.

| Properties Heldfor Sale Policy Text Block | Properties Held for SaleA property or a group of properties is reported in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for current and prior periods if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results when either: (i) the component has been disposed of or (ii) is classified as held for sale. At such time as a property is held for sale, such property is carried at the lower of: (i) its carrying amount or (ii) fair value less costs to sell. In addition, a property being held for sale ceases to be depreciated. We classify operating properties as property held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met:•management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset;•the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets;•an active program to locate a buyer or buyers and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset has been initiated;•the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year;•the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and•given the actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset, it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan would be made or that the plan would be withdrawn. | c-1 |  |

| Real Estate Depreciation And Amortization Policy Policy Text Block | Real Estate Investments, NetWe carry our operating properties at our historical cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of operating properties includes the cost of land and completed buildings and related improvements, including those related to financing obligations. Expenditures that increase the service life of properties are capitalized and the cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. The cost of buildings and capital improvements is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and capital improvements, up to39years, and the cost for tenant improvements is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life, up to34years. The cost of furniture, fixtures and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful life, up to28years. When depreciable property is retired, replaced or disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings.As part of the leasing process, we may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements. These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term. If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event we are not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease inducement and is included in other assets, net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Lease inducement is amortized over the lease term as a reduction of real estate revenue on a straight-line basis. Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g.,unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process). Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease. Recognition of lease revenue commences when the lessee is given possession of the leased space upon completion of tenant improvements when we are the owner of the leasehold improvements. However, when the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant, the lease inception date (and the date on which recognition of lease revenue commences) is the date the tenant obtains possession of the leased space for purposes of constructing its leasehold improvements. | c-1 |  |

| Real Estate Policy Text Block | Real Estate Investments Purchase Price AllocationUpon the acquisition of real estate properties or entities owning real estate properties, we determine whether the transaction is a business combination, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. If the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed; however, for a transaction accounted for as an asset acquisition, we capitalize transaction costs and allocate the purchase price using a relative fair value method allocating all accumulated costs, whereas for a transaction accounted for as a business combination, we immediately expense transaction costs incurred associated with the business combination and allocate the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of each separately identifiable asset and liability. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our investment transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions or as business combinations, as applicable. See Note 3, Real Estate Investments, Net — Acquisitions of Real Estate Investments, and Note 4, Business Combinations, for a further discussion.We, with assistance from independent valuation specialists, measure the fair value of tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities, as applicable, based on their respective fair values for acquired properties. Our method for allocating the purchase price to acquired investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes determining the value of the buildings, land, leasehold interests, furniture, fixtures and equipment, above- or below-market rent, in-place leases, master leases, tenant improvements, above- or below-market debt assumed, derivative financial instruments assumed, and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, if any. These estimates require significant judgment and in some cases involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments directly impact our results of operations, as amounts allocated to certain assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization | c-1 |  |

Our former advisor, subject to the oversight and review of our board, provided asset management, property management, acquisition, disposition and other advisory services on our behalf consistent with our investment policies and objectives. Until September 30, 2021, all of our executive officers were officers of our former advisor and officers, limited partners and/or members of one of our former co-sponsors and other affiliates of our former advisor.Prior to the Merger and the AHI Acquisition, our former advisor was75.0% owned and managed by wholly-owned subsidiaries of AHI and25.0% owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital, or collectively, our former cosponsors. Prior to the AHI Acquisition, AHI was47.1% owned by AHI Group Holdings,45.1% indirectly owned by DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE: DBRG), or DigitalBridge, and7.8% owned by James F. Flaherty III. We were not affiliated with Griffin Capital, DigitalBridge or Mr. Flaherty; however, we were affiliated with our former advisor, AHI and AHI Group Holdings.On December 20, 2021, the Advisory Agreement was assigned to NewCo, and as a result, any fees that would have otherwise been payable to our former advisor are no longer being paid to a third party. Following the consummation of the Merger in October 2021, we became self-managed and as a result we no longer incur any fees or expense reimbursements to our former advisor and its affiliates arising from the Advisory Agreement. | c-1 |  |
| Revenue From Contract With Customer Policy Text Block | Revenue RecognitionReal Estate RevenueWe recognize real estate revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 842. See the “Leases” section above.Resident Fees and Services RevenueWe recognize resident fees and services revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606. A significant portion of resident fees and services revenue represents healthcare service revenue that is reported at the amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for providing patient care. These amounts are due from patients, third-party payors (including health insurers and government programs), other healthcare facilities, and others and includes variable consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlement of audits, reviews, and investigations. Generally, we bill the patients, third-party payors and other healthcare facilities several days after the services are performed. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices, any changes to these governmental revenue estimates are recorded in the period the change or adjustment becomes known based on final settlement. Any differences between recorded revenues and subsequent adjustments are reflected in operations in the year finalized.Performance obligations are determined based on the nature of the services provided by us. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time is recognized based on actual charges incurred in relation to total expected (or actual) charges. This method provides a depiction of the transfer of services over the term of the performance obligation based on the inputs needed to satisfy the obligation. Generally, performance obligations satisfied over time relate to patients receiving long-term healthcare services, including rehabilitation services. We measure the performance obligation from admission into the facility to the point when we are no longer required to provide services to that patient. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied at a point in time is recognized when goods or services are provided and we do not believe we are required to provide additional goods or services to the patient. Generally, performance obligations satisfied at a point in time relate to sales of our pharmaceuticals business or to sales of ancillary supplies.Because all of our performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, we have elected to apply the optional exemption provided in ASC Topic 606 and, therefore, are not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed within months of the end of the reporting period.We determine the transaction price based on standard charges for goods and services provided, reduced, where applicable, by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, implicit price concessions provided to uninsured patients, and estimates of goods to be returned. We also determine the estimates of contractual adjustments based on Medicare and Medicaid pricing tables and historical experience. We determine the estimate of implicit price concessions based on the historical collection experience with each class of payor.Agreements with third-party payors typically provide for payments at amounts less than established charges. The following is a summary of the payment arrangements with major third-party payors:•Medicare:Certain healthcare services are paid at prospectively determined rates based on cost-reimbursement methodologies subject to certain limits.•Medicaid:Reimbursements for Medicaid services are generally paid at prospectively determined rates. In the state of Indiana, we participate in an Upper Payment Limit program, or IGT, with various county hospital partners, which provides supplemental Medicaid payments to SNFs that are licensed to non-state, government-owned entities such as county hospital districts. We have operational responsibility through management agreements for facilities retained by the county hospital districts including this IGT. The licenses and management agreements between the nursing center division and hospital districts are terminable by either party to restore the previous licensed status.•Other:Payment agreements with certain commercial insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations provide for payment using prospectively determined rates per discharge, discounts from established charges and prospectively determined periodic rates. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | 18. Segment ReportingWe evaluate our business and make resource allocations based onfourreportable business segments: integrated senior health campuses, or ISHC, OM, triple-net leased properties and SHOP. Our OM buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants under separate leases, thus requiring active management and responsibility for many of the associated operating expenses (much of which are, or can effectively be, passed through to the tenants). Our integrated senior health campuses each provide a range of independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. Our triple-net leased properties segment includes senior housing, skilled nursing facilities and hospital investments, which are single-tenant properties for which we lease the facilities to unaffiliated tenants under triple-net and generally master leases that transfer the obligation for all facility operating costs (including maintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures) to the tenant. In addition, our triple-net leased properties segment includes our debt security investment. Our SHOP segment includes senior housing, which may provide assisted living care, independent living, memory care or skilled nursing services that are owned and operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.While we believe that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement, we evaluate our segments’ performance based upon segment net operating income, or NOI. We define segment NOI as total revenues and grant income, less property operating expenses and rental expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions of real estate investments, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency gain or loss, other income and income tax benefit or expense for each segment. We believe that segment NOI serves as an appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because it allows investors and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization and other expenses not attributable to individual properties are not allocated to individual segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. Non-segment assets primarily consist of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, deferred financing costs and other assets not attributable to individual properties. | c-1 |  |
| Segment Reporting Policy Policy Text Block | Segment DisclosureWe segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management reviews our performance and makes operating decisions. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we modified how we evaluate our business and make resource allocations, and therefore determined that we operate throughfourreportable business segments; integrated senior health campuses, OM (which was formerly known as MOBs), triple-net leased properties and SHOP. All segment information included in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements has been recast for all periods presented to reflect four reportable business segments and the change in segment name from MOBs to OM. The segment name change from MOBs to OM did not result in any changes to the composition of such segment or information reviewed by management, and therefore, had no impact on the historical results of operations. | c-1 |  |

| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Such consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto are the representations of our management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing our accompanying consolidated financial statements.Basis of PresentationOur accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our operating partnership, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries in which we have control, as well as any VIEs, in which we are the primary beneficiary. The portion of equity in any subsidiary that is not wholly owned by us is presented in our accompanying consolidated financial statements as a noncontrolling interest. We evaluate our ability to control an entity, and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, by considering substantive terms of the arrangement and identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance.On November 15, 2022, we effected a one-for-four reverse stock split of our common stock and a corresponding reverse split of the OP units, or the Reverse Splits. All numbers of common shares and per share data, as well as the OP units, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Splits.We operate and intend to continue to operate in an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our operating partnership, wholly-owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership and all non-wholly owned subsidiaries of which we have control will own substantially all of the interests in properties acquired on our behalf.We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, we owned a95.0% general partnership interest therein, and the remaining5.0% limited partnership interest was owned by the NewCo Sellers, as defined in Note 4, Business Combinations — 2021 Business Combinations.The accounts of our operating partnership are consolidated in our accompanying consolidated financial statements because we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and have unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions (even if additional limited partners are admitted to our operating partnership). All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited | c-1 |  |

We acquired such12facilities by assuming the outstanding principal balance of each related mortgage loan payable from one of the borrowers.
