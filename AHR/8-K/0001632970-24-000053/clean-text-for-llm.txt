American Healthcare REIT (“AHR”) Announces First Quarter 2024 Results
American Healthcare REIT, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) (NYSE: AHR) announced today its first quarter 2024 results.
Key Highlights:
•
Reported GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(0.04) per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
•
Reported Normalized Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders (“NFFO”) of $0.30 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
•
Achieved 7.1% total portfolio Same-Store (“SS”) revenue growth for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, largely driven by improved performance in the Company’s RIDEA-operated assets.
•
Achieved total portfolio Same-Store Net Operating Income (“NOI”) growth of 13.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, highlighted by 33.5% and 19.9% Same-Store NOI growth from its senior housing operating properties (“SHOP”) and integrated senior health campuses (“ISHC”), respectively.
•
Disposed of approximately $15.6 million of Non-Core Properties across the Company’s outpatient medical (“OM”) and SHOP segments.
•
Acquired a 14-property portfolio in Oregon for approximately $94.5 million that is managed by Compass Senior Living in a RIDEA structure.
•
Completed a public offering of 64.4 million shares of its common stock priced at a public offering price of $12.00 per share and listed such common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “AHR”.
•
Paid down approximately $721.5 million of outstanding debt obligations carrying a weighted average interest rate of approximately 7.5%, substantially improving leverage metrics and providing the Company with additional borrowing capacity and flexibility.
“After completing our offering and listing event in February, our main focus is on delivering strong operating performance across our property segments. The year is off to a solid start, as we captured outsized growth within our RIDEA-operated assets due to the supply-demand imbalance present in the senior housing industry. Our assets are well positioned and staffed appropriately to capitalize on further near-term demand tailwinds, which we believe will drive additional occupancy gains and rate growth,” said Danny Prosky, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer.

First Quarter 2024 Results
The Company’s active asset management continues to strengthen top-line growth, in addition to effectively managing controllable expenses. In aggregate, NOI growth remains on track to achieve the growth contemplated within the Company’s 2024 total portfolio Same-Store NOI growth guidance range.

“Our hands-on active asset management approach is proving its merits, as evidenced by the stellar performance of our recently acquired Oregon portfolio. After only two months of owning and operating the portfolio, with Compass Senior Living as our operating partner, the properties have meaningfully improved bottom-line performance and, while still early, are trending ahead of our initial expectations,” said Gabe Willhite, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer.
Full Year 2024 Guidance
The Company’s following guidance ranges for the year ending December 31, 2024, originally announced on March 21, 2024 in the Company’s Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release, remain unchanged:

Certain of the assumptions underlying the Company’s 2024 guidance can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings release and in the appendix of the Company’s First Quarter 2024 Supplemental Financial Information (“Supplemental”). A reconciliation of Net Loss calculated in accordance with GAAP to NAREIT FFO and NFFO can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings release. Non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, as used in this earnings release, are also defined and further explained in the Supplemental. The Company does not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measures of total revenues and property operating and maintenance expenses. Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of Same-Store NOI growth to the comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because the Company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net (gain)/loss on sale of previously depreciated real estate assets, stock-based compensation, casualty loss, non-Same-Store revenues, and non-Same-Store operating expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on the Company's GAAP results for the guidance period.

Transaction Activity
As previously announced, on February 1, 2024, the Company acquired a senior housing portfolio in Oregon consisting of 856 beds across 14 properties. The total consideration consisted of approximately $94.5 million of assumed debt, plus closing costs, reflecting a price per bed of approximately $110,000. The assumed debt has a fixed interest rate of 4.54% and matures on January 1, 2028. The portfolio is managed by Compass Senior Living through a RIDEA structure. The Company has a longstanding relationship with Compass Senior Living as a tenant in its triple-net leased properties segment and recognized the strength of the operator through the COVID-19 pandemic. The management agreement is the Company’s first RIDEA structure with Compass Senior Living, expanding the Company’s high-quality operator relationships.
Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company disposed of two Non-Core OM buildings and one Non-Core SHOP facility for approximately $15.6 million in aggregate gross proceeds, of which $11 million was previously announced.
Subsequent to quarter end, through the Company’s Trilogy REIT Holdings investment, the Company redeemed all the remaining equity interests in Trilogy owned by members of Trilogy management and certain members of Trilogy’s advisory committee. As a result, as of April 15, 2024, the Company owns 76% of Trilogy. As previously reported, the Company also has an option to purchase the remaining 24% of Trilogy that is owned by a joint venture partner until September 30, 2025 at a predetermined price.
Capital Markets and Balance Sheet Activity
As previously announced, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company completed a public offering of 64.4 million shares of its common stock, raising gross offering proceeds of $772.8 million, and listed such common stock on the NYSE under the symbol “AHR”. During the quarter, the Company paid down approximately $721.5 million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 7.5%. This significant reduction in outstanding debt improved the Company's leverage by meaningfully reducing near-term maturities and high-interest floating-rate debt. Additionally, during the quarter the Company amended its existing credit facility, extending its maturity date and increasing its borrowing capacity to up to $1.15 billion. The credit facility consists of an unsecured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate amount of $600 million and an unsecured term loan facility in the initial aggregate amount of $550 million. The revolving portion of the credit facility now matures on February 14, 2028, and may be extended for one 12-month period, subject to certain conditions, and the term loan portion of the facility matures on January 19, 2027.
As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s total Pro-Rata indebtedness was $1.75 billion, and the Company had approximately $914.5
million of total consolidated liquidity comprised of cash and undrawn capacity on its lines of credit.
“Utilizing proceeds from our public offering in February, we were able to pay down floating-rate indebtedness, bringing our net-debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio down to 6.4x at the end of the first quarter. We believe that the organic earnings growth embedded in our previously announced Normalized FFO and Same-Store portfolio guidance for the remainder of the year should result in further improvement to our leverage ratios,” said Brian Peay, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.

Distribution
As previously announced, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash distribution for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of $0.25 per share of its common stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock. The first quarter distribution was paid in cash on April 19, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 28, 2024.

Definitions
Adjusted EBITDA:
EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and pursuit costs, gain (loss) on sales of real estate, unrealized foreign currency gain (loss), change in fair value of financial instruments, impairment of real estate assets, lease termination revenue, non-recurring items, and adjusted for non-controlling interest.
Cash NOI:
NOI excluding the impact of, without duplication, (1) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (2) third-party facility rent payments and (3) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments.
EBITDA:
A non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
GAAP revenue:
Revenue recognized in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), which includes straight line rent and other non-cash adjustments.
ISHC:
Integrated senior health campuses include a range of senior care, including independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses. Integrated senior health campuses are predominantly operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.
NAREIT FFO or FFO:
Funds from operations attributable to controlling interest; a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT (the “White Paper”). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.
Net Debt:
Total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash pertaining to debt.
NOI:
Net operating income; a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency gain or loss, other income and income tax benefit or expense.
Non-Core Properties:
Assets that have been deemed not essential to generating future economic benefit or value to our day-to-day operations and/or are projected to be sold.
Normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest or NFFO:
FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): expensed acquisition fees and costs, which we refer to as business acquisition expenses; amounts relating to changes in deferred rent and amortization of above and below-market leases (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments
Page | 16
from a GAAP accrual basis); the non-cash impact of changes to our equity instruments; non-cash or non-recurring income or expense; the noncash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; capitalized interest; impairment of goodwill; amortization of closing costs on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect Normalized FFO on the same basis.
Occupancy:
With respect to OM, the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported. With respect to all other property types, occupancy represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available data. The Company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to calculate occupancy and has not independently verified the information. Occupancy metrics are reflected at our Pro-Rata share.
Outpatient Medical or OM:
Outpatient Medical buildings.
Pro-Rata:
As of March 31, 2024, we owned and/or operated our 126 integrated senior health campuses through entities of which we owned 75.4% of the ownership interests and eight other buildings through entities of which we owned 90.0% to 98.0% of the ownership interests. Because we have a controlling interest in these entities, these entities and the properties these entities own are consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, while such properties are presented in our financial statements on a consolidated basis, we are only entitled to our Pro-Rata share of the net cash flows generated by such properties. As a result, we have presented certain property information herein based on our Pro-Rata ownership interest in these entities and the properties these entities own, as of the applicable date, and not on a consolidated basis. In such instances, information is noted as being presented on a “Pro-Rata share” basis.
RIDEA:
Used to describe properties within the portfolio that utilize the RIDEA structure as described in “RIDEA structure”.
RIDEA structure:
A structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, pursuant to which we lease certain healthcare real estate properties to a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), which in turn contracts with an
eligible independent contractor (“EIK”) to operate such properties for a fee. Under this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and the TRS receives revenue from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and retains, as profit, any revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including intercompany rent paid to us and any taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate the property. Through the RIDEA structure, in addition to receiving rental revenue from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and benefit from any improved operational performance while bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties.
Same-Store or SS:
Properties owned and consolidated the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded. Properties are excluded from Same-Store if they are: (1) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in
Page | 17
accordance with GAAP; (2) impacted by materially disruptive events, such as flood or fire for an extensive period of time; or (3) scheduled to undergo or currently undergoing major expansions/renovations or business model transitions or have transitioned business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
Same-Store NOI or SS NOI:
Cash NOI for our Same-Store properties. Same-Store NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments.
SHOP:
Senior housing operating properties.
Square Feet or Sq. Ft.:
Net rentable square feet calculated utilizing Building Owners and Managers Association measurement standards.
Total Debt:
The principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans and secured indebtedness as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Trilogy:
Trilogy Investors, LLC; one of our consolidated joint ventures, in which we indirectly owned a 75.4% interest as of March 31, 2024.
Trilogy REIT Holdings:
Trilogy REIT Holdings, LLC; the joint venture between the Company and NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. that owns the interest in Trilogy or Trilogy Investors, LLC.
Triple-net leased:
A lease where the tenant is responsible for making rent payments, maintaining the leased property and paying property taxes and other expenses.

16 2024 Guidance(1) (1) Company's guidance constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions  that are subject to change and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Actual results may differ materially from the Company's expectations  depending on factors discussed herein and in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Totals may not add due to rounding.  Non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, as used in this supplemental, are also defined and further explained in the appendix. The Company does  not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measures of total revenues and property operating and maintenance expenses.  Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of Same-Store NOI growth to the comparable GAAP financial measures  cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because the Company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures,  including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to,  impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net (gain)/loss on sale of previously depreciated real estate assets, stock-based compensation, casualty  loss, non-Same-Store revenues, and non-Same-Store operating expenses.

28 • Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and pursuit costs, gain (loss) on sales of real estate, unrealized  foreign currency gain (loss), change in fair value of financial instruments, impairment of real estate assets, lease termination revenue, non-recurring items, and  adjusted for non-controlling interest. • Affiliated: An OM (as defined on the next page) that, as of a specified date, has 25.0% or more of its square footage occupied by at least one healthcare system. • AL: Assisted living units. • Annualized Adjusted EBITDA: Current period (shown as quarterly) EBITDA multiplied by 4. • Annualized Base Rent or ABR: Contractual base rent for the last month of the applicable period multiplied by 12. • Cash NOI: NOI excluding the impact of, without duplication, (1) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (2) third-party facility  rent payments and (3) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments.  • EBITDA: A non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  • EBITDAR: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and facilities rent. We use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to  calculate EBITDAR and have not independently verified the information.  • EBITDAR Coverage: The ratio of EBITDAR to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. EBITDAR Coverage is a measure of a property’s  ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations. • EBITDARM: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. We use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by  tenants to calculate EBITDARM and have not independently verified the information. • EBITDARM Coverage: The ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. EBITDARM Coverage is a measure of a  property’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator or borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations, assuming that management fees are not paid.  • GAAP revenue: Revenue recognized in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), which includes straight line rent and other non-cash  adjustments. • GLA: Gross leasable area. • Grant Income: Stimulus funds granted to us through various federal and state government programs, such as the CARES Act, established for eligible healthcare  providers to preserve liquidity in response to lost revenues and/or increased healthcare expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; such grants are not loans  and, as such, are not required to be repaid, subject to certain conditions. • Hospital: Hospital properties typically will include acute care, long-term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals and generally will be leased to single tenants  or operators under triple-net lease structures. • IL: Independent living units. • Integrated senior health campuses or ISHC: Integrated senior health campuses include a range of senior care, including independent living, assisted living, memory  care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses. Integrated senior health campuses are predominantly operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. • Maintenance Capex: AHR-invested capital expenditures, whether routine or non-routine (including second generation tenant incentives and leasing commissions), that  extend the useful life of a property but are not expected to generate incremental income for the Company. • MC: Memory-care units. • NAREIT FFO or FFO: Funds from operations attributable to controlling interest; a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White  Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT (the “White Paper”). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP,  excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment write-downs of  certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint  ventures. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that impairments are based on estimated  future undiscounted cash flows. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO. Defined Terms
29 • NAV: Net asset value. • Net Debt: Total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash pertaining to debt.  • NOI: Net operating income; a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before  general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions, impairment of real  estate investments, impairment of goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency  gain or loss, other income and income tax benefit or expense. • Non-Core Properties: Assets that have been deemed not essential to generating future economic benefit or value to our day-to-day operations and/or are scheduled to  be sold. • Normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest or NFFO: FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss):  expensed acquisition fees and costs, which we refer to as business acquisition expenses; amounts relating to changes in deferred rent and amortization of above and  below-market leases (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis); the non-cash impact of changes to our equity instruments; non- cash or non-recurring income or expense; the noncash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; capitalized interest; impairment of goodwill; amortization of closing  costs on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of  debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; after adjustments  for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect Normalized FFO on the same basis. • Occupancy: With respect to OM, the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported. With  respect to all other property types, occupancy represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available data. The Company uses  unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to calculate occupancy and has not independently verified the information. Occupancy metrics are  reflected at our Pro-Rata share.  • OM: Outpatient Medical buildings.  • OP unit: Units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, which are redeemable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for- one basis, subject to certain adjustments. • Operating Partnership: American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, through which we conduct substantially all of our business and of which  Continental Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner. • Pro-Rata: As of March 31, 2024, we owned and/or operated our 126 integrated senior health campuses through entities of which we owned 75.4% of the ownership  interests and eight other buildings through entities of which we owned 90.0% to 98.0% of the ownership interests. Because we have a controlling interest in these  entities, these entities and the properties these entities own are consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, while such properties are  presented in our financial statements on a consolidated basis, we are only entitled to our Pro-Rata share of the net cash flows generated by such properties. As a result,  we have presented certain property information herein based on our Pro-Rata ownership interest in these entities and the properties these entities own, as of the  applicable date, and not on a consolidated basis. In such instances, information is noted as being presented on a “Pro-Rata share” basis.  • Quality Mix: Total number of Medicare, Managed Care, Medicare Advantage and private days of revenue divided by the total number of actual patient days or total  revenue for all payor types within Skilled Nursing and Senior Housing beds in the ISHC segment. • Retention: The ratio of total renewed square feet and month-to-month leases retained to the total square feet expiring, excluding the square feet for tenant leases  terminated and leases in assets expected to be sold for the trailing 12-months.  • RevPOR: Revenue per occupied room. RevPOR is calculated as total revenue generated by occupied rooms divided by the number of occupied rooms. • RIDEA: Used to describe properties within the portfolio that utilize the RIDEA structure as described in “RIDEA structure”.

30 • RIDEA structure: A structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, pursuant to which we lease certain healthcare real  estate properties to a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS), which in turn contracts with an eligible independent contractor (EIK) to operate such properties for a  fee. Under this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and the TRS receives revenue from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and retains, as  profit, any revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including intercompany rent paid to us and any taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate the property.  Through the RIDEA structure, in addition to receiving rental revenue from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the healthcare real estate  properties and benefit from any improved operational performance while bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties. • Same-Store or SS: Properties owned and consolidated the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded. Properties are excluded from  Same-Store if they are: (1) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (2)  impacted by materially disruptive events, such as flood or fire for an extensive period of time; or (3) scheduled to undergo or currently undergoing major  expansions/renovations or business model transitions or have transitioned business models after the start of the prior comparison period. • Same-Store NOI or SS NOI: Cash NOI for our Same-Store properties. Same-Store NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent  population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments. • Senior Housing-Leased: Senior housing facilities cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs and include assisted living,  memory care and independent living. Residents of assisted living facilities typically require limited medical care and need assistance with eating, bathing, dressing  and/or medication management, and those services can be provided by staff at the facility. Resident programs offered at such facilities may include transportation,  social activities and exercise and fitness programs. Our Senior Housing-Leased properties are triple-net leased. • SHOP: Senior housing operating properties. • SNFs: Skilled nursing facilities. • Square Feet or Sq.
