In connection with the Offering, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated February 6, 2024, by and among us, American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP (the "Operating Partnership"), BofA Securities, Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriting Agreement”).
The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements by us and the Operating Partnership, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of us, the Operating Partnership and the underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act, certain other obligations of the parties and termination provisions.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
As disclosed in the Registration Statement filed in connection with the Offering, our board of directors (the “Board”) granted restricted stock awards to certain of our directors, named executive officers and employees, subject to and effective upon the completion of the Offering.
The awards granted to our employees, including our named executive officers, include, in the aggregate, 912,966 shares of restricted Common Stock and will vest in 25% increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the February 9, 2024 closing date of the Offering, subject to the grantee’s continuous service through the applicable vesting date.

As a result of the Articles Supplementary and our Board's previously adopted resolutions, we are prohibited from electing to be subject to Section 3-803 of the MGCL, which would permit us to classify our Board without stockholder approval, and such prohibition may not be repealed unless the repeal of such prohibition is approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast on the matter by our stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

================================================================================

February 12, 2024   Dear Fellow Stockholder:  We write to you to share an important and exciting update for American Healthcare REIT, Inc. (the  “Company”) regarding the Company’s recently concluded underwritten public offering (the “Offering”)  and related listing of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). On February 7,  2024, the Company’s common stock was listed and began trading the NYSE. On February 9, 2024, the  Company closed its Offering raising approximately $717.6 million in net proceeds.  As previously communicated, the Company filed its initial registration statement on Form S-11 with the  Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2022 with the intent to issue shares of its common  stock in an underwritten public offering when the time was right. Since then, our team has worked  diligently to close an offering that we believe effectively positions the Company for future growth. The  Company’s executive management team, together with its Board of Directors, believe the Offering was an  important step towards providing the Company access to attractive capital available from the public  markets in addition to providing pre-Offering stockholders liquidity when their shares automatically  convert into shares of common stock listed on the NYSE on August 5, 2024. Net proceeds from the  Offering in the amount of $717.6 million were used to reduce outstanding debt. Over time, we believe  that this will strengthen the Company’s balance sheet, improve the Company’s cost of capital and  enhance the Company’s performance through internal and strategic external growth.  Now, more than ever, is an exciting time for healthcare real estate. We believe an aging population, along  with increasing life expectancy, means that there is a growing need and demand for healthcare services  across the country. Our team is enthusiastic and focused on creating value for the Company’s  stockholders through the public markets in this next phase. As we enter the next chapter of the  Company’s history, we want to express our sincere gratitude to the Company’s stockholders who have  supported the Company’s mission over the years.  Of course, we understand that legacy holders of Class T and Class I common stock will likely have  questions regarding this announcement and how it impacts their holdings. Please refer to the enclosed list  of “Frequently Asked Questions” which addresses most questions received from pre-Offering  stockholders. Moreover, please look out for further communications from us, as we will continue to share  new updates on the progress of the Company in the coming months.   Kind regards,  Danny Prosky  Chief Executive Officer and President EXHIBIT 99.1
Page 2 of 4    American Healthcare REIT | 18191 Von Karman Ave. | Suite 300 | Irvine, CA 92612  Frequently Asked Questions    1. When did the Company close the Offering?     The Company determined the initial public offering price of common stock sold in the Offering on  February 6, 2024, its common stock was listed on the NYSE on February 7, 2024, and it closed the  Offering on February 9, 2024.     2. What price did the Company sell stock at in the Offering?    The initial public offering price for shares of the Company’s common stock sold in the Offering was  $12.00 per share. The Company’s common stock is now listed on the NYSE, and its trading price can be  expected to fluctuate over time and will depend on a number of factors, such as the reputation of  healthcare REITs specifically, the attractiveness of the Company’s equity securities in comparison to  other equity securities, the Company’s actual and projected financial results, the Company’s  distribution policy and general stock and market conditions.    3. What is the Company’s stock ticker symbol on the NYSE?    AHR    4. Why did the Company list its common stock on the NYSE?    The Company listed its common stock on the NYSE in order to enhance its ability to access the public  capital markets, raise capital to strengthen its balance sheet and position the Company for further  growth, while providing for future liquidity to pre-Offering stockholders.     5. Where can I find additional information regarding the Offering?    You can find additional information regarding the offering within the “News” or “SEC Filings” section  on our Investor Relations website (https://ir.americanhealthcarereit.com/).    6. Now that the Company listed its common stock on the NYSE, are pre-Offering stockholders able to sell  their shares immediately on the NYSE?     No, pre-Offering stockholders are not able to sell their shares on the NYSE until August 5, 2024.  Note that the Company’s management and members of the Board of Directors will also not be  permitted to sell their shares for 180 days.    On the 180th day (August 5, 2024) after the date of the listing of the Company’s common stock sold in  the Offering on the NYSE, each outstanding share of the Company’s Class T common stock and Class I  common stock will automatically, and without any stockholder action, convert into one share of the  Company’s listed common stock, and thereafter be freely tradable on the NYSE. Current holders of  Class T common stock and Class I common stock will not be able to sell such shares on the NYSE until  such conversion occurs.
Page 3 of 4    American Healthcare REIT | 18191 Von Karman Ave. | Suite 300 | Irvine, CA 92612  7. On August 5, 2024, which is 180 days from the date of the initial listing of the Company’s common  stock on the NYSE, do I need to do anything for the conversion of Class T common stock and Class I  common stock to NYSE-listed common stock if I hold my shares directly?    No. However, if you currently hold your shares directly with Computershare and wish to transfer to a  brokerage account once the conversion of Class T common stock and Class I common stock to the  NYSE-listed common stock is completed, you can contact your broker and request the shares be  transferred through the Depository Trust Company’s Direct Registration Profile System (a.k.a. DRS  Transfer). You will need to supply your broker with a copy of your latest statements and the following  information:    • Your Computershare account number (on your statement)  • Your Social Security Number  • Computershare’s DTC number, [7807]  • The number of whole shares you wish to move from your Computershare account to your  brokerage account    Advisors can access their client’s statements at www.computershare.com/advisorportal.    8. Will distributions be paid to Class T and Class I shareholders?    Yes. While any distributions must be authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors and declared by  the Company at such times and in such amounts as the Company’s Board of Directors determines, the  Company intends to make quarterly distributions to its common stockholders (including holders of  Class T common stock and Class I common stock), based on an initial quarterly distribution rate of  $0.25 per share of common stock.     9. How and when was the net asset value (“NAV”) last determined, and why was the initial public  offering price in the Offering different from the last NAV?    The Company’s estimated per share NAV, last updated as of December 31, 2022 and published in  March 2023, was determined after consultation with an independent third-party valuation firm and  based on the estimated value of the Company’s assets, less the estimated value of its liabilities,  divided by the number of shares of Class T Common Stock and Class I Common Stock outstanding on a  fully diluted basis, in each case as of December 31, 2022. This valuation was performed in accordance  with the methodology provided in practice guideline 2013-01, valuations of publicly registered non- listed REITs, issued by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives in April 2013, in addition to guidance from  the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company has not updated its estimated per share NAV  since December 31, 2022.    In contrast to the estimated NAV per share described above, the February 6, 2024 initial public  offering price in the Offering was determined through negotiations between the Company and the  underwriters of the Offering and was based on various matters that differ from those used by the  third-party valuation firm in determining the Company’s estimated per share NAV as of December 31,  2022.
Page 4 of 4    American Healthcare REIT | 18191 Von Karman Ave. | Suite 300 | Irvine, CA 92612  Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated per  share NAV, and these differences could be significant. The estimated per share NAV as of December  31, 2022 was not audited and does not represent the fair value of the Company’s assets less its  liabilities according to GAAP, nor does it represent a liquidation value of the Company’s assets and  liabilities or the amount its shares of common stock would trade at on a national securities exchange.  The estimated asset values may not represent the book value. The estimated value of the appraised  properties does not necessarily represent the value the Company would receive or accept if the assets  were marketed for sale, whereas the current trading price is a dynamic and real-time reflection of  market clearing prices between a willing seller and willing buyer of the Company’s shares.     Since the NAV was last updated, the capital markets and the healthcare real estate market have been  impacted by the changes in interest rates and investor appetite for real estate assets. Please note that  it is not uncommon for the market capitalization of a company to be different from the NAV or book  value of a company’s underlying assets (market capitalization is the total value of a company’s  outstanding stock, calculated by multiplying the price of a share of the company’s stock and the total  number of shares outstanding).     10. Is the Company’s management or Board of Directors selling shares of common stock?    No. The Company, its directors and executive officers and holders of units in the Company’s operating  partnership that may be exchanged for shares of the Company’s common stock have agreed not to sell  or otherwise dispose of any of their common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or  exchangeable for shares of the Company’s common stock until August 5, 2024, without the prior  written consent of the representatives on behalf of the underwriters of the Offering.     11. Has the Company’s distribution reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) been impacted by the listing on the  NYSE and the Offering?    The DRIP remains suspended at this time for investors who own shares of either Class T common stock  or Class I common stock.     12. Has the Company’s share repurchase plan (the “SRP”) been impacted by the listing on the NYSE and  the Offering?    The SRP remains suspended at this time.     13. Who do I contact if I have questions?    The Company’s Investor Services team can be reached at 844-460-9414. You can also visit the Investor  Relations page on the Company’s website at www.americanhealthcarereit.com.

We intend for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward- looking statements contained in the Acts. Such forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such  as “may,” “will,” “can,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “possible,” “initiatives,” “focus,” “seek,” “objective,” “goal,”  “strategy,” “plan,” “potential,” “potentially,” “preparing,” “projected,” “future,” “long-term,” “once,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “might,” “uncertainty,”  "avenues," "targeting," "pursue," "opportunity," "positioned," “poised,” “path,” "upside,“ “allow,” or other similar words. Readers are cautioned not to  place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statement is made. Any such forward-looking  statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, and beliefs of, and  assumptions made by, our management and involve uncertainties that could significantly affect our financial results. Such statements include, but are  not limited to: (1) statements about our plans, strategies, initiatives and prospects, including potential future capital-raising initiatives and planned or  future acquisitions or dispositions of properties and other assets, including our option to purchase the minority membership interest in Trilogy REIT  Holdings; (2) statements about the anticipated impact of the merger between Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., and Griffin-American Healthcare  REIT IV, Inc.; (3) statements about the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, including its duration and potential or expected impact on our business and  our view on forward trends and (4) statements about our future results of operations, capital expenditures and liquidity. Such statements are subject to  known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including, without  limitation: changes in economic conditions generally and the real estate market specifically; the continuing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,  including its effects on the healthcare industry, senior housing and skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) and the economy in general; legislative and  regulatory changes, including changes to laws governing the taxation of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”); the availability of capital; our ability to  pay down, refinance, restructure or extend our indebtedness as it becomes due; our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal  income tax purposes; changes in interest rates, including uncertainties about whether and when interest rates will continue to increase, and foreign  currency risk; competition in the real estate industry; changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) policies and guidelines  applicable to REITs; the success of our investment strategy, including our ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate new acquisitions;  cybersecurity incidents and information technology failures, including unauthorized access to our computer systems and/or our vendors' computer  systems, and our third-party management companies' computer systems and/or their vendors' computer systems; our ability to retain our executive  officers and key employees; unexpected labor costs and inflationary pressures; and other risk factors as outlined in our filings with the U.S. Securities  and Exchange Commission.

DISCLAIMERS 3 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This presentation includes certain financial measures, such as net operating income (“NOI”), cash NOI and Same-Store NOI, that are calculated and  presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may use similarly titled non‐GAAP financial measures  that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non‐GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to such  similarly titled non‐GAAP measures of other companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non‐GAAP measures, but instead to  consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non‐GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be  considered in isolation. These non‐GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and not as superior to, financial measures  prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the Appendix for a reconciliation of each of these non‐GAAP financial measures to the most directly  comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the Appendix hereto.

Under this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and the TRS receives revenue from the operation of the  healthcare real estate properties and retains, as profit, any revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including intercompany rent paid to us and any taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate  the property. Through the RIDEA structure, in addition to receiving rental revenue from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and benefit  from any improved operational performance while bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties. “SBRA” means Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. “Same-Store” means properties that were owned, consolidated and operational for the entirety of all relevant periods presented and were not otherwise excluded. SHOP, senior housing—leased, SNFs  and hospital properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in Same-Store once operating under consistent operating structures for the entirety of all relevant  periods presented. Properties are excluded from Same-Store if they were: (1) sold, classified as held for sale, or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance  with GAAP; (2) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (3) for SHOP, properties that are undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment during a period presented; and (4) for  the SHOP and senior housing—leased, SNFs and hospital segments, properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business  models after the start of the earliest period presented. “SHOP” means senior housing operating properties.  “Trilogy” means Trilogy Investors, LLC, one of our consolidated joint ventures, in which we indirectly owned a 74.0% interest as of September 30, 2023. “VTR” means Ventas, Inc.  “WELL” means Welltower Inc. 15
NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses,  depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of  previously held equity interest, foreign currency gain or loss, other income, and income tax benefit or expense. Cash NOI is defined as NOI but excluding the impact of, without duplication (1) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (2) third party facility rent payments and (3) other items  set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. Same-Store NOI is defined as Cash NOI for our Same-Store properties. Same-Store NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a  consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments. NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI, Cash NOI  and Same-Store NOI should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as an indication of our operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity. NOI,  Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.  Investors are also cautioned that NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should only be used to assess our operational performance in periods in which we have not incurred or accrued any business acquisition expenses. We believe that NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are appropriate supplemental performance measures to reflect the performance of our operating assets because NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI exclude certain  items that are not associated with the operations of the properties. We believe that NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are widely accepted measures of comparative operating performance in the real estate community.
