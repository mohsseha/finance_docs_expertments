Page | 1  Press Release   Irvine, CA – March 21, 2024              Contact: Alan Peterson  Email: investorrelations@ahcreit.com  American Healthcare REIT (“AHR”) Announces Fourth Quarter 2023  and Full Year 2023 Results; Issues Full Year 2024 Guidance   American Healthcare REIT, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE: AHR) announced today its fourth quarter and full  year 2023 results. Further, the Company reported various subsequent-to-quarter-end items.  Key Highlights:  • Reported GAAP net loss attributable to stockholders of $(0.42) and $(1.08) per basic and diluted share for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023. • Reported Normalized Funds from Operations attributable to stockholders (“NFFO”) of $0.38 and $1.40 per basic and diluted share for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023, respectively. • Achieved 5.2% and 7.7% total portfolio Same-Store (“SS”) revenue growth for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022 largely driven by occupancy gains in the Company’s RIDEA-operated assets. • Achieved year-over-year total portfolio Same-Store Net Operating Income (“NOI”) growth of 8.6%, highlighted by 27.2% and 14.0% Same-Store NOI growth from our SHOP and Integrated Senior Health Campuses (“ISHC”), respectively. • Disposed of approximately $195 million of Non-Core Properties across the Company’s Outpatient Medical and SHOP segments during the 12 months ended December 31, 2023. • Subsequent to year end, completed a public offering of 64.4 million shares of our common stock priced at $12.00 per share and listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “AHR”. • Subsequent to year end, paid down approximately $721 million of outstanding debt obligations carrying a weighted average interest rate of approximately 7.53% using the net proceeds from the public offering, meaningfully improving leverage metrics and providing the Company with additional capacity and flexibility. “We are proud of our 2023 operating results and have begun 2024 with a successful common stock  offering and the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. As a publicly listed company, we are  committed to being responsible stewards of capital for all our stockholders. The entire team at American  Healthcare REIT is working diligently to ensure optimal performance across our entire portfolio,” said  Danny Prosky, American Healthcare REIT’s President and CEO.  EXHIBIT 99.1
Page | 2    Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Results  “Our portfolio continues to recover since the onset of the pandemic, with the trajectory of revenue  growth drivers all heading in the right direction. We have continued to see occupancy gains since the end  of 2023. Our unique investment in Integrated Senior Health Campuses remains the most attractive part  of our portfolio with operating performance metrics such as occupancy already surpassing pre- pandemic levels,” said Gabe Willhite, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer.  SS NOI Growth Rates: Quarter Ended December 31, 2023 Relative to Quarter Ended December 31, 2022  Metric 4Q 2023 Actual  ISHC   Outpatient Medical   SHOP   Triple-Net Leased   Total Portfolio  13.9%  2.3%  44.9%  3.5%  9.5%    SS NOI Growth Rates: Year Ended December 31, 2023 Relative to Year Ended December 31, 2022  Metric FY 2023 Actual  ISHC   Outpatient Medical  SHOP   Triple-Net Leased  Total Portfolio  14.0%  3.2%  27.2%  2.0%  8.6%    Same-Store revenue for our RIDEA-operated assets grew by 6.0% and 8.9% during the three months and  year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Expense growth  across our SHOP assets has moderated, partially due to recent operator transitions and normalizing  compensation expenses as a result of less agency-labor usage across the portfolio. In aggregate, NOI  growth remains well above historical levels across the portfolio, as margin and occupancy continue to  recover from pandemic-era troughs.  Full Year 2024 Guidance   The Company has established the following guidance ranges for the year ending December 31, 2024:   Full Year 2024 Guidance  Metric FY 2023  Actual  FY 2024 Range FY 2024 Midpoint  NAREIT FFO per share  Normalized FFO per share    Total Portfolio SS NOI Growth:  $0.99  $1.40    8.6%  $1.13 to $1.19  $1.18 to $1.24    5.0% to 7.0%  $1.16  $1.21    6.0%  Certain of the assumptions underlying the Company’s 2024 outlook can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings  release and in the appendix of the Company’s Fourth Quarter 2023 Supplemental Financial Information (“Supplemental”). A reconciliation of  Net Loss calculated in accordance with GAAP to NAREIT FFO and NFFO can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings  release. Non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, as used in this earnings release, are also defined and further explained in the  Supplemental. Within this release, we provide certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information, which management uses for  planning and measuring performance. We are not able to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures to reported measures without  unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact or exact timing of items  that may impact comparability throughout the year.
Page | 3    “We believe 2024 should be another year of occupancy gains within our SHOP segment that should  support NOI growth and margin expansion. Looking at our ISHC segment, we expect occupancy to  remain at or above pre-pandemic levels over the course of the year. In aggregate, our guidance estimates  another year of mid-single-digit NOI growth across our entire diversified healthcare portfolio,” said  Prosky.   Transactional Activity  During full year 2023, the Company completed a campus acquisition and three lease buyouts within its  ISHC segment for total consideration of approximately $43.9 million, plus closing costs. We expect these  acquisitions to generate a yield on cost of approximately 9.0%.  During 2023, the Company sold 16 Non-Core outpatient medical facilities and six Non-Core SHOP  facilities generating approximately $195 million in gross proceeds.   Subsequent to quarter end, the Company continued to opportunistically dispose of Non-Core assets, and  has sold an outpatient medical building in Marietta, Georgia and a SHOP facility in Menlo Park, California  for approximately $11 million in aggregate gross proceeds.   Additionally, as previously announced, on February 1, 2024, the Company closed on the acquisition of a  senior housing portfolio in Oregon consisting of 856 beds across 12 facilities. The total consideration  consisted of $94.5 million of assumed debt, plus closing costs, reflecting a price per bed of  approximately $110,000. The assumed debt has a fixed interest rate of 4.54% and matures on January 1,  2028. The portfolio will be managed by Compass Senior Living through a RIDEA structure. The Company  has a longstanding relationship with Compass Senior Living as a tenant in our triple-net leased segment  and recognized the strength of the operator through the COVID-19 pandemic. The management  agreement will be the Company’s first with Compass Senior Living expanding the Company’s high-quality  operator relationships.  Capital Markets and Balance Sheet Activity  On December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a $200 million swap agreement relating to debt at the  ISHC portfolio, swapping SOFR for a fixed rate of 4.40% on its variable-rate debt. This agreement was  effective as of January 5, 2024. The Company now carries $750 million of interest rate swap agreements  fixing SOFR at a weighted average interest rate of 4.16%.  Subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed a public offering of 64.4 million shares of its  common stock, raising gross proceeds of $772.8 million, and listed its common stock on the NYSE under  the symbol “AHR”.  This represented the largest REIT offering and listing event in the US since 20181. Net  offering proceeds were used to pay down approximately $721 million of outstanding debt with a weighted  average interest rate of 7.53%. As previously announced, as of February 16, 2024, the Company had $747  million of outstanding balances on its lines of credit and term loan, with a weighted average interest rate  of 5.91% (taking into account the effect of swap instruments), and $803 million of undrawn capacity  under its lines of credit and term loan. This significant reduction in outstanding debt has resulted in an  improvement in the Company's leverage by meaningfully reducing near-term maturities and high-interest    1Per NAREIT based on data available since 2000, which can be found at: https://www.reit.com/data-research/reit-market-data/reit- capital-offerings
Page | 4    floating-rate debt. In aggregate, the pay downs will result in approximately $54 million in interest  expense savings on an annualized basis.  “After repaying approximately $721 million of indebtedness with the net proceeds from our January 2024  public equity offering, we estimate that we will be in the low 6x net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA range at  March 31, 2024. As we look ahead, we will maintain a conservative approach to leverage, while being  selective regarding external growth opportunities. The offering and debt repayment were transformative  for our capital structure, and we believe that the embedded growth within our SHOP and ISHC segments  will allow our leverage profile to continue to improve,” said Brian Peay, the Company’s Chief Financial  Officer.  Distribution  As previously announced, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash  distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 of $0.25 per share of its common stock, Class T  common stock and Class I common stock. The distribution is payable on or about April 19, 2024 to  stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 28, 2024.   Supplemental Information  The Company has disclosed supplemental information regarding its portfolio, financial position and  results of operations as of December 31, 2023 and for the quarter and year then ended, and certain other  information, which is available on the Company's website at https://ir.americanhealthcarereit.com.  Conference Call and Webcast Information  The Company will host a webcast and conference call at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 22, 2023.  During the conference call, Company executives will review fourth quarter and full year 2023 results,  discuss recent events, and conduct a question-and-answer period.

The Company does not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measures of total revenues and property operating  and maintenance expenses. Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of Same-Store NOI growth  to the comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because the Company is unable to reasonably  predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the  Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net (gain)/loss on  sale of previously depreciated real estate assets, stock-based compensation, casualty loss, non-Same-Store revenues, and non-Same-Store  operating expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on the Company's GAAP  results for the guidance period.
Page | 15    Definitions    Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based  compensation expense, acquisition and pursuit costs, gain (loss) on sales of real estate, unrealized  foreign currency gain (loss), change in fair value of financial instruments, impairment of real estate  assets, lease termination revenue, non-recurring items, and adjusted for non-controlling interest.  Affiliated: means an OM (as defined on the next page) that, as of a specified date, has 25.0% or more of  its square footage occupied by at least one healthcare system.  AL: refers to assisted living units.  Annualized Adjusted EBITDA: current period (shown as quarterly) EBITDA multiplied by 4.  Annualized Base Rent or ABR: contractual base rent for the last month of the applicable period  multiplied by 12.  Cash NOI: Cash NOI is defined as NOI but excluding the impact of, without duplication, (1) non-cash  items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (2) third party facility rent  payments and (3) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. Both Cash NOI  and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments.   EBITDA: EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization.   EBITDAR: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and facilities rent. We use  unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to calculate EBITDAR and have not  independently verified the information.   EBITDAR Coverage: represents the ratio of EBITDAR to contractual rent for leases or interest and  principal payments for loans. EBITDAR Coverage is a measure of a property’s ability to generate  sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations.  EBITDARM: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. We  use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to calculate EBITDARM and  have not independently verified the information.  EBITDARM Coverage: represents the ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and  principal payments for loans. EBITDARM coverage is a measure of a property’s ability to generate  sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations, assuming that  management fees are not paid.   GAAP revenue: revenue recognized in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  (“GAAP”), which includes straight line rent and other non-cash adjustments.  GLA: gross leasable area.  Grant Income: stimulus funds granted to us through various federal and state government programs,  such as the CARES Act, established for eligible healthcare providers to preserve liquidity in response to  lost revenues and/or increased healthcare expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; such  grants are not loans and, as such, are not required to be repaid, subject to certain conditions.
Page | 16    Hospital: hospital properties typically will include acute care, long term acute care, specialty and  rehabilitation hospitals and generally will be leased to single tenants or operators under triple-net  lease structures.  IL: refers to independent living units.  Integrated senior health campuses or ISHC: Integrated senior health campuses include a range of  senior care, including independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services, and  certain ancillary businesses. Integrated Senior Health Campuses are predominantly operated utilizing  a RIDEA structure.  Maintenance Capex: AHR-invested capital expenditures, whether routine or non-routine (including  second generation tenant incentives and leasing commissions), that extend the useful life of a property  but are not expected to generate incremental income for the Company.  MC: refers to memory-care units.  NAREIT FFO or FFO: funds from operations attributable to controlling interest is a non-GAAP financial  measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board  of Governors of NAREIT (the “White Paper”). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss)  computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets,  gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment write downs of  certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate,  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While impairment charges  are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that impairments  are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships  and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.  NAV: Net asset value.  Net Debt: Total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents  and restricted cash pertaining to debt.   NOI: Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss),  computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative  expenses, business acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss  on dispositions, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of goodwill, income or loss from  unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency  gain or loss, other income, and income tax benefit or expense.  Non-Core Properties: assets that have been deemed not essential to generating future economic  benefit or values to our day-to-day operations and/or are scheduled for closure or to be sold.  Normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest or NFFO: Normalized FFO attributable to  controlling interest is defined as FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the  determination of GAAP net income (loss): expensed acquisition fees and costs, which we refer to as  business acquisition expenses; amounts relating to changes in deferred rent and amortization of above  and below-market leases (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual  basis); the non-cash impact of changes to our equity instruments; non-cash or non-recurring income  or expense; the noncash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; capitalized interest; impairment of
Page | 17    goodwill; amortization of closing costs on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in  net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt,  hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a  fundamental attribute of the business plan; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated  partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect Normalized FFO on the  same basis.  Occupancy: OM occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and  occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported. Occupancy for all other property  types represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available  data. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to  calculate occupancy and has not independently verified the information. Occupancy metrics are  reflected at our pro rata share.   OM: Outpatient Medical Buildings.   OP unit: units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, which are redeemable for  cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain  adjustments.  Operating Partnership: means American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership,  through which we conduct substantially all of our business and of which Continental Merger Sub, LLC, a  Delaware limited liability company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole general partner.  Pro-Rata: As of December 31, 2023, we owned and/or operated our 125 integrated senior health  campuses through entities of which we owned 74.1% of the ownership interests and 10 other buildings  through entities of which we owned 86.0% to 98.0% of the ownership interests. Because we have a  controlling interest in these entities, these entities and the properties these entities own are  consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, while such properties are  presented in our financial statements on a consolidated basis, we are only entitled to our pro rata share  of the net cash flows generated by such properties. As a result, we have presented certain property  information in this supplemental presentation based on our pro rata ownership interest as of the  applicable date in properties included in these entities and not on a consolidated basis. In such  instances, information is noted as being presented on a “pro-rata share” basis.   RevPOR: Revenue per occupied room. RevPOR is calculated as total revenue generated by occupied  rooms divided by the number of occupied rooms.  RIDEA: used to describe properties within the portfolio that utilize the RIDEA structure as described in  “RIDEA structure”.  RIDEA structure: a structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act  of 2007, pursuant to which we lease certain healthcare real estate properties to a wholly-owned  taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS), which in turn contracts with an eligible independent contractor (EIK) to  operate such properties for a fee. Under this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and the  TRS receives revenue from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and retains, as profit,  any revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including intercompany rent paid to us and any  taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate the property. Through the RIDEA structure, in addition to
Page | 18    receiving rental revenue from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the  healthcare real estate properties and benefit from any improved operational performance while  bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties.  Same-Store or SS: Properties owned and consolidated the full period in both comparison periods and  that are not otherwise excluded. Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (1) sold,  classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in  accordance with GAAP; (2) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire for an  extensive period of time; or (3) and properties that are scheduled to undergo major  expansions/renovation, business model transitions, or have transitioned business models after the  start of the prior comparison period.  Same-Store NOI or SS NOI: is defined as Cash NOI for our Same-Store properties. Same-Store NOI is  used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which  controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include  ownership and other adjustments.  Senior Housing-Leased: Senior housing facilities cater to different segments of the elderly population  based upon their personal needs, and include assisted living, memory care, and independent living.  Residents of assisted living facilities typically require limited medical care and need assistance with  eating, bathing, dressing, and/or medication management and those services can be provided by staff  at the facility. Resident programs offered at such facilities may include transportation, social  activities, and exercise and fitness programs. Our Senior Housing-Leased properties are triple-net  leased.  SHOP: senior housing operating properties.  SNFs: skilled nursing facilities.  SOFR: The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash  overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. SOFR as it relates to the Company is used as the  benchmark rate for its floating-rate debt obligations.    Square Feet or Sq. Ft.: Net rentable square feet calculated utilizing Building Owners and Managers  Association measurement standards.   Total Debt: The principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, and secured  indebtedness as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  Trilogy: Trilogy Investors, LLC, one of our consolidated joint ventures, in which we indirectly owned a  74.1% interest as of December 31, 2023.  Triple-net leased: a lease where the tenant is responsible for making rent payments, maintaining the  leased property and paying property taxes and other expenses.  Yield on cost: annualized in-place Cash NOI or EBITDAR divided by the aggregate investment cost and  any debt being assumed.

27 2024 Earnings Guidance Reconciliation (1) Amounts presented net of noncontrolling interests' share and AHR's share of unconsolidated entities. The foregoing projections reflect management's view of current and future market conditions. There can be no assurance that the Company's actual results will  not differ materially from the estimates set forth above. Except as otherwise required by law, the Company assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to  update any of the foregoing projections as a result of new information or new or future developments. The Company does not provide guidance for the most  comparable GAAP financial measures of total revenues and property operating and maintenance expenses. Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking  non-GAAP financial measures of Same Store NOI growth to the comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because  the Company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative  of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net (gain)/loss on sale of  previously depreciated real estate assets, stock-based compensation, casualty loss, non-Same-Store revenues, and non-Same-Store operating expenses.  These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on the Company's GAAP results for the guidance period.

28 • Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and pursuit costs, gain (loss) on sales  of real estate, unrealized foreign currency gain (loss), change in fair value of financial instruments, impairment of real estate assets, lease termination revenue, non- recurring items, and adjusted for non-controlling interest. • Affiliated: means an OM (as defined on the next page) that, as of a specified date, has 25.0% or more of its square footage occupied by at least one healthcare system. • AL: refers to assisted living units. • Annualized Adjusted EBITDA: current period (shown as quarterly) EBITDA multiplied by 4. • Annualized Base Rent or ABR: contractual base rent for the last month of the applicable period multiplied by 12. • Cash NOI: Cash NOI is defined as NOI but excluding the impact of, without duplication, (1) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease  intangibles, (2) third party facility rent payments and (3) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include  ownership and other adjustments.  • EBITDA: EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.  • EBITDAR: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and facilities rent. We use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to  calculate EBITDAR and have not independently verified the information.  • EBITDAR Coverage: represents the ratio of EBITDAR to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. EBITDAR Coverage is a measure of a  property’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations. • EBITDARM: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. We use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by  tenants to calculate EBITDARM and have not independently verified the information. • EBITDARM Coverage: represents the ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. EBITDARM coverage is a measure of  a property’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations, assuming that management fees are not paid.  • GAAP revenue: revenue recognized in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), which includes straight line rent and other non-cash  adjustments. • GLA: gross leasable area. • Grant Income: stimulus funds granted to us through various federal and state government programs, such as the CARES Act, established for eligible healthcare  providers to preserve liquidity in response to lost revenues and/or increased healthcare expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; such grants are not loans  and, as such, are not required to be repaid, subject to certain conditions. • Hospital: hospital properties typically will include acute care, long term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals and generally will be leased to single tenants or  operators under triple-net lease structures. • IL: refers to independent living units. • Integrated senior health campuses or ISHC: Integrated senior health campuses include a range of senior care, including independent living, assisted living, memory  care, skilled nursing services, and certain ancillary businesses. Integrated Senior Health Campuses are predominantly operated utilizing a RIDEA structure. • Maintenance Capex: AHR-invested capital expenditures, whether routine or non-routine (including second generation tenant incentives and leasing commissions), that  extend the useful life of a property but are not expected to generate incremental income for the Company. • MC: refers to memory-care units. • NAREIT FFO or FFO: funds from operations attributable to controlling interest is a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White  Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT (the “White Paper”). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP,  excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment write downs of  certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint  ventures.

However, while such properties are  presented in our financial statements on a consolidated basis, we are only entitled to our pro rata share of the net cash flows generated by such properties. As a result,  we have presented certain property information in this supplemental presentation based on our pro rata ownership interest as of the applicable date in properties  included in these entities and not on a consolidated basis. In such instances, information is noted as being presented on a “pro-rata share” basis.  • Quality Mix: Total number of Medicare, Managed Care, Medicare Advantage and private days of revenue divided by the total number of actual patient days or total  revenue for all payor types within Skilled Nursing and Senior Housing beds in the ISHC segment. • Retention: The ratio of total renewed square feet and month-to-month leases retained to the total square feet expiring, excluding the square feet for tenant leases  terminated and leases in assets expected to be sold for the trailing 12-months. • RevPOR: Revenue per occupied room.

Under this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and  the TRS receives revenue from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and retains, as profit, any revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including  intercompany rent paid to us and any taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate the property. Through the RIDEA structure, in addition to receiving rental revenue  from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and benefit from any improved operational performance while  bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties. • Same-Store or SS: Properties owned and consolidated the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded.
