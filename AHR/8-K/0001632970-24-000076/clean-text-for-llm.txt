American Healthcare REIT (“AHR”) Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results;
Increases Full Year 2024 Guidance
American Healthcare REIT, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “management,” or “us”) (NYSE: AHR) announced today its second quarter 2024 results and updated its full year 2024 guidance.
Key Highlights:
•
Reported GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.01 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2024.
•
Reported Normalized Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders (“NFFO”) of $0.33 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2024.
•
Reported GAAP net income of $2.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to GAAP net loss of $(11.9) million for the same period in 2023.
•
Achieved total portfolio Same-Store Net Operating Income (“NOI”) growth of 15.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, highlighted by 49.1% and 24.1% Same-Store NOI growth from its senior housing operating properties (“SHOP”) and integrated senior health campuses (“ISHC”), respectively.
•
Increased total portfolio Same-Store NOI growth guidance for the year ending December 31, 2024 by 700 basis points at the midpoint from a range of 5.0% to 7.0% to a revised range of 12.0% to 14.0%, due to better-than-expected operations across all of its property segments for the year ending December 31, 2024.
•
Increased NFFO guidance for the year ending December 31, 2024 by $0.04 at the midpoint from a range of $1.18 to $1.24 to a revised range of $1.23 to $1.27, primarily due to increased expectations for NOI growth for its Same-Store portfolio. The increase to NFFO guidance for the year ending December 31, 2024, is partially offset by the increase in interest expense expectations.
•
Reported a 0.5x improvement in the Company's Net-Debt-to-Annualized Adjusted EBITDA from 6.4x as of March 31, 2024 to 5.9x as of June 30, 2024.
“Our first year as a listed company is off to a great start. Demand for healthcare real estate is evident in our portfolio performance. Growth in the first half of 2024 is exceeding the expectations we set at the beginning of the year prompting our upward revisions to Same-Store NOI growth guidance and NFFO guidance. As we plan for the balance of the year and into 2025, we expect the elevated levels of Same-Store NOI growth to persist due to the demand-supply imbalance present in long-term care,” said Danny Prosky, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer.

Second Quarter and Year-to-date 2024 Results
The Company’s Same-Store NOI growth results are detailed below. Hands-on asset management resulting in increased occupancy and expense management continues to support bottom-line results.

“Property performance across our ISHC and SHOP segments remains strong. Having built sector-leading occupancy through the first half of 2024, we believe we have the opportunity to further enhance pricing power strategies to continue strengthening performance across our ISHC and SHOP segments. We believe our occupancy gains in addition to positive RevPOR growth in the first half of the year will continue to benefit Same-Store NOI growth results in the back half of 2024 and into early 2025,” said Gabe Willhite, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer.

____________
Certain of the assumptions underlying the Company’s 2024 guidance can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings release and in the appendix of the Company’s Second Quarter 2024 Supplemental Financial Information (“Supplemental”). A reconciliation of Net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP to NAREIT FFO and NFFO can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings release. Non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, as used in this earnings release, are also defined and further explained in the Supplemental. The Company does not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measures of total revenues and property operating and maintenance expenses. Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures of Same-Store NOI growth to the comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because the Company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net gain or loss on sale of real estate assets, stock-based compensation, casualty loss, non-Same-Store revenues and non-Same-Store operating expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on the Company’s GAAP results for the guidance period.
Transactional Activity
During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company exercised the purchase options on three previously leased ISHC properties for approximately $45.8 million. The lease rate on such leases was approximately 9.1%. The Company continues to market assets for sale and is not changing sales proceed expectations of approximately $65.0 million for the full year ending December 31, 2024. The Company has sold approximately $15.6 million of Non-Core Properties during the six months ended June 30, 2024.
Capital Markets and Balance Sheet Activity
As of June 30, 2024, the Company’s total Pro-Rata indebtedness was $1.80 billion, and the Company had approximately $863.1
million of total consolidated liquidity comprised of cash and undrawn capacity on its lines of credit. The Company's Net-Debt-to-Annualized Adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2024 was 5.9x.
Subsequent to quarter end, on August 5, 2024 (180 days after the Company's initial listing of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange), the Company completed the conversion of all of its shares of Class T common stock and Class I common stock into the Company’s listed shares of common stock.
“We are increasing our full year 2024 Same-Store NOI growth and earnings guidance to reflect the occupancy gains and results we have achieved in 2024.  The robust organic earnings growth thus far has allowed us to further improve our company’s leverage profile with improving Net-Debt-to-Annualized-Adjusted EBITDA and we anticipate continuing to improve with disposition proceeds and incremental earnings growth,” said Brian Peay, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.
Distribution
As previously announced, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash distribution for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 of $0.25 per share of its common stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock. The second quarter distribution was paid in cash on July 19, 2024 to stockholders of record as of June 27, 2024.

The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in those acts. Such forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as “may,” “will,” “can,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “possible,” “initiatives,” “focus,” “seek,” “objective,” “goal,” “strategy,” “plan,” “potential,” “potentially,” “preparing,” “projected,” “future,” “long-term,” “once,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “might,” “uncertainty” or other similar words.

Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this release.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company’s reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company also discloses the following Non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO, NFFO, NOI and Same-Store NOI. The Company believes these Non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental measures of its operating performance and used by investors and analysts to compare the operating performance of the Company between periods and to other REITs or companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items. Definitions of the Non-GAAP financial measures used herein and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP can be found at the end of this earnings release. See below for further information regarding the Company's Non-GAAP financial measures.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
Management uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used by investors, lenders, credit and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations of companies. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are utilized by our Board of Directors to evaluate management. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other REITs or other companies.
Funds from Operations (FFO) and Normalized Funds from Operations (NFFO)
We believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our operating performance to investors, industry analysts and our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss). However, FFO and NFFO should not be construed to be (i) more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance, (ii) more relevant or accurate than GAAP cash flows from operations as an indicator of our liquidity or (iii) indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the Non-GAAP FFO and NFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and NFFO. Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors, industry analysts and management as they compare the operating performance metrics used by the REIT industry, although it should be noted that some REITs may use different methods of calculating funds from operations and normalized funds from operations, so comparisons with such REITs may not be meaningful.
Net Operating Income
We believe that NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are appropriate supplemental performance measures to reflect the performance of our operating assets because NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI exclude certain items that are not associated with the operations of
Page | 5
the properties. We believe that NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are widely accepted measures of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the terms NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing these amounts.
NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity. NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss). NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance.

Integrated senior health campuses include a range of senior care, including independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services and certain ancillary businesses. Integrated senior health campuses are predominantly operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.
NAREIT FFO or FFO:
Funds from operations attributable to controlling interest; a Non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT (the “White Paper”). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.
Net Debt:
Total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash pertaining to debt.
NOI:
Net operating income; a Non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on dispositions, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency gain or loss, other income or expense and income tax benefit or expense.
Non-Core Properties:
Assets that have been deemed not essential to generating future economic benefit or value to our day-to-day operations and/or are projected to be sold.
Normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest or NFFO:
FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): expensed acquisition fees and costs, which we refer to as business acquisition expenses; amounts relating to changes in deferred rent and amortization of above and below-market leases (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis); the non-cash impact of changes to our equity instruments; non-cash or non-recurring income or expense; the noncash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; capitalized interest; impairment of intangible assets and goodwill; amortization of closing costs on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or

securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect Normalized FFO on the same basis.
Occupancy:
With respect to OM, the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported. With respect to all other property types, occupancy represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available data. The Company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to calculate occupancy and has not independently verified the information. Occupancy metrics are reflected at our Pro-Rata share.
Outpatient Medical or OM:
Outpatient Medical buildings.
Pro-Rata:
As of June 30, 2024, we owned and/or operated our 126 integrated senior health campuses through entities of which we owned 76.0% of the ownership interests and eight other buildings through entities of which we owned 90.0% to 98.0% of the ownership interests. Because we have a controlling interest in these entities, these entities and the properties these entities own are consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, while such properties are presented in our financial statements on a consolidated basis, we are only entitled to our Pro-Rata share of the net cash flows generated by such properties. As a result, we have presented certain property information herein based on our Pro-Rata ownership interest in these entities and the properties these entities own, as of the applicable date, and not on a consolidated basis. In such instances, information is noted as being presented on a “Pro-Rata share” basis.
RevPOR:
Revenue per occupied room. RevPOR is calculated as total revenue generated by occupied rooms divided by the number of occupied rooms.
RIDEA:
Used to describe properties within the portfolio that utilize the RIDEA structure as described in “RIDEA structure”.
RIDEA structure:
A structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, pursuant to which we lease certain healthcare real estate properties to a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), which in turn contracts with an
eligible independent contractor (“EIK”) to operate such properties for a fee. Under this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and the TRS receives revenue from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and retains, as profit, any revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including intercompany rent paid to us and any taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate the property. Through the RIDEA structure, in addition to receiving rental revenue from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and benefit from any improved operational performance while bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties.
Same-Store or SS:
Properties owned or consolidated the full year in both comparison years and that are not otherwise excluded. Properties are excluded from Same-Store if they are: (1) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (2) impacted by materially disruptive events, such as flood or fire for an extensive period of time; or (3) scheduled to undergo or currently undergoing major expansions/renovations or business model transitions or have transitioned business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
Same-Store NOI or SS NOI:
Cash NOI for our Same-Store properties. Same-Store NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments.
SHOP:
Senior housing operating properties.
Square Feet or Sq. Ft.:
Net rentable square feet calculated utilizing Building Owners and Managers Association measurement standards.
Page | 18
Total Debt:
The principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans and secured indebtedness as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Trilogy:
Trilogy Investors, LLC; one of our consolidated joint ventures, in which we indirectly owned a 76.0% interest as of June 30, 2024.
Trilogy REIT Holdings:
Trilogy REIT Holdings, LLC; the joint venture between the Company and NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. that owns the interest in Trilogy or Trilogy Investors, LLC.
Triple-net leased:
A lease where the tenant is responsible for making rent payments, maintaining the leased property and paying property taxes and other expenses.

Second Quarter 2024 Supplemental EXHIBIT 99.2
2 Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this supplemental, filed in conjunction with the Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Press Release, including statements relating to American  Healthcare REIT, Inc.’s (the ”Company”) expectations regarding its portfolio growth, interest expense savings, balance sheet, net income per share, FFO per share, NFFO per  share, total portfolio SS NOI growth, segment-level Same-Store NOI growth, occupancy, NOI growth, revenue growth, and margin expansion, may be considered forward- looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The  Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in those acts. Such  forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “can,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,”  “continue,” “possible,” “initiatives,” “focus,” “seek,” “objective,” “goal,” “strategy,” “plan,” “potential,” “potentially,” “preparing,” “projected,” “future,” “long-term,” “once,” “should,”  “could,” “would,” “might,” “uncertainty,” or other similar words. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of  the date this supplemental. Any such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which the  Company operates and beliefs of, and assumptions made by, the Company's management and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual  results to differ materially from those expressed or implied therein, including, without limitation, risks disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports as filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this  supplemental. Disclaimers
3 Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company’s reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company also discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  NAREIT FFO, NFFO, NOI and Same-Store NOI. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental measures of its operating performance and  used by investors and analysts to compare the operating performance of the Company between periods and to other REITs or companies on a consistent basis without having  to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures used herein and reconciliations to the most  directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP can be found at the end of this earnings release. See below for further information regarding the  Company's non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Management uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our  historical operating results and in making operating decisions. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used by investors, lenders, credit and equity analysts in the valuation,  comparison, investment recommendations of companies. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are utilized by our Board of Directors to evaluate management. Neither  EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered  as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other REITs or other  companies. Funds from Operations (FFO) and Normalized Funds from Operations (NFFO) We believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further understanding of our  operating performance to investors, industry analysts and our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy  rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss). However, FFO and  NFFO should not be construed to be (i) more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating  performance, (ii) more relevant or accurate than GAAP cash flows from operations as an indicator of our liquidity or (iii) indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs,  including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a  more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and NFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating  FFO and NFFO. Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors, industry analysts and management as they compare the operating  performance metrics used by the REIT industry, although it should be noted that some REITs may use different methods of calculating funds from operations and normalized  funds from operations, so comparisons with such REITs may not be meaningful. Net Operating Income We believe that NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are appropriate supplemental performance measures to reflect the performance of our operating assets  because NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI exclude certain items that are not associated with the operations of the properties. We believe that NOI, Cash  NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are widely accepted measures of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However, our use of the terms  NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing  these amounts. NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring  operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as an  indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity. NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store  NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss). NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI  should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance. Disclaimers

17 2024 Guidance(1) (1) The Company's guidance constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is based on a number of  assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Actual results may differ materially from the Company's  expectations depending on factors discussed herein and in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Totals may not add due to  rounding. Non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, as used in this supplemental, are also defined and further explained in the appendix. The Company  does not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measures of total revenues and property operating and maintenance expenses. Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of Same-Store NOI growth to the comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because the Company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net gain or loss on sale of real estate assets, stock-based compensation, casualty loss, non-Same-Store  revenues, and non-Same-Store operating expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on the      Company's GAAP results for the guidance period. See reconciliations in the appendix of this presentation. (2) Amounts are presented net of noncontrolling interests' share and AHR's share of unconsolidated entities.

EBITDAR Coverage is a measure of a property’s ability to  generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations. • EBITDARM: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. We use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by  tenants to calculate EBITDARM and have not independently verified the information. • EBITDARM Coverage: The ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans.

With respect  to all other property types, occupancy represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available data.

Because we have a controlling interest in these entities, these  entities and the properties these entities own are consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, while such properties are presented in our  financial statements on a consolidated basis, we are only entitled to our Pro-Rata share of the net cash flows generated by such properties. As a result, we have presented  certain property information herein based on our Pro-Rata ownership interest in these entities and the properties these entities own, as of the applicable date, and not on a  consolidated basis. In such instances, information is noted as being presented on a “Pro-Rata share” basis.  • Quality Mix: Total number of Medicare, Managed Care, Medicare Advantage and private days of revenue divided by the total number of actual patient days or total revenue for  all payor types within Skilled Nursing and Senior Housing beds in the ISHC segment. • Retention: The ratio of total renewed square feet and month-to-month leases retained to the total square feet expiring, excluding the square feet for tenant leases  terminated and leases in assets expected to be sold for the trailing 12-months.  • RevPOR: Revenue per occupied room.

31 • RIDEA structure: A structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, pursuant to which we lease certain healthcare real estate  properties to a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS), which in turn contracts with an eligible independent contractor (EIK) to operate such properties for a fee. Under  this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and the TRS receives revenue from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and retains, as profit, any  revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including intercompany rent paid to us and any taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate the property. Through the RIDEA  structure, in addition to receiving rental revenue from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and benefit from any  improved operational performance while bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties. • Same-Store or SS: Properties owned or consolidated the full year in both comparison years and that are not otherwise excluded.

Same-Store NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent  population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments. • Senior Housing-Leased: Senior housing facilities cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs and include assisted living, memory  care and independent living. Residents of assisted living facilities typically require limited medical care and need assistance with eating, bathing, dressing and/or medication  management, and those services can be provided by staff at the facility.
