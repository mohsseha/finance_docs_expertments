However, while such properties are presented in the Company’s financial statements on a consolidated basis,  the Company is only entitled to its Pro-Rata share of the net cash flows generated by such properties.

DEFINED TERMS 45
NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses,  depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re- measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency gain or loss, other income, and income tax benefit or expense. Cash NOI is defined as NOI but excluding the impact of, without duplication (1) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (2) third party facility rent payments and (3) other items set  forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. Same-Store NOI is defined as Cash NOI for the Company’s Same-Store properties. Same-Store NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of the Company’s   properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of the Company’s portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments. NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are not equivalent to the Company’s net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI, Cash  NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as an indication of the Company’s operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of the  liquidity. NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating the Company’s  operating performance. Investors are also cautioned that NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should only be used to assess its operational performance in periods in which we have not incurred or accrued any business  acquisition expenses. We believe that NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are appropriate supplemental performance measures to reflect the performance of its operating assets because NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI exclude certain items  that are not associated with the operations of the properties. We believe that NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are widely accepted measures of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. However,  the Company’s use of the terms NOI, Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing these amounts.
