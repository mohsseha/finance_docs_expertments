Second Amendment and Restatement to Credit Facilities
As previously reported, on January 25, 2019, we, through American Healthcare REIT Holdings, LP, or the Operating Partnership, formally known as Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III Holdings, LP, its parent, formally known as Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., as successor by merger with Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a credit agreement, or the 2019 Corporate Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America; KeyBank, National Association, or KeyBank; Citizens Bank, National Association, or Citizens Bank; and a syndicate of other banks, as lenders, to obtain a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount of $630,000,000, or the 2019 Corporate Line of Credit. The 2019 Corporate Line of Credit initially consisted of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $150,000,000 and a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $480,000,000. On January 19, 2022, we entered into an agreement, or the 2022 Credit Agreement, that amended, restated, superseded and replaced the 2019 Corporate Credit Agreement to provide for a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount up to $1,050,000,000, or the 2022 Credit Facility. The 2022 Credit Facility consisted of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate amount of $500,000,000 and a senior unsecured term loan facility in the initial aggregate amount of $550,000,000.
On February 14, 2024, we, through the Operating Partnership, as borrower, certain of our subsidiaries, or the subsidiary guarantors, and our company, collectively as guarantors, entered into an agreement, or the 2024 Credit Agreement, that amends, restates, supersedes and replaces the 2022 Credit Agreement with Bank of America, as administrative agent and letters of credit issuer; KeyBank and Citizens Bank, as syndication agents for the revolving facility and the term loan facility and letters of credit issuers; Bank of the West, as a syndication agent for the term loan facility, Fifth Third Bank, National Association, or Fifth Third Bank, as documentation agent for the term loan facility, Truist Bank and Regions Bank, as managing agents for the term loan facility; Barclays Bank PLC; Citibank, N.A.; Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank; Fifth Third Bank; Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.; Regions Bank; Royal Bank of Canada and Truist Bank, as managing agents for the revolving facility; KeyBanc Capital Markets and Citizens Bank as joint lead arrangers for the revolving facility and the term loan facility; and BofA Securities, Inc., as a joint lead arranger and sole bookrunner for the revolving facility and the term loan facility, to obtain a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount up to $1,150,000,000, or the 2024 Credit Facility. The 2024 Credit Facility consists of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the initial aggregate amount of $600,000,000 and a senior unsecured term loan facility in the initial aggregate amount of $550,000,000.
Unless defined herein, all capitalized terms are as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, the Revolving Loans mature on February 14, 2028, and may be extended for one 12-month period, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee. The Term Loan matures on January 19, 2027, and may not be extended. The maximum principal amount of the 2024 Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate incremental amount of $600,000,000, subject to: (i) the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement; and (ii) at least five business days’ prior written notice to Bank of America.
The 2024 Credit Facility bears interest at varying rates based upon, at our option, (i) the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or Daily SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Daily SOFR Rate Loans or (ii) the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or the Term SOFR, plus the Applicable Rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans. If, under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, there is an inability to determine the Daily SOFR or the Term SOFR, then the 2024 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for Base Rate Loans. The loans may be repaid in whole or in part without prepayment premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.
We are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the lenders’ commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement computed at (a) 0.25% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is less than or equal to 50% and (b) 0.20% per annum if the actual daily Commitment Utilization Percentage for such quarter is greater than 50%, which fee shall be computed on the actual daily amount of the Available Commitments during the period for which payment is made and payable in arrears on a quarterly basis.
At any time that the Applicable Rate is determined based on the Debt Ratings Based Pricing Grid, we are required to pay a facility fee as determined in the Debt Ratings Based Pricing Grid multiplied by the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or, if the Aggregate Revolving Commitments have terminated, the Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations, regardless of usage.
The 2024 Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for credit facilities and transactions of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of debt by our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and limitations on secured recourse indebtedness. The 2024 Credit Agreement also imposes certain financial covenants based on the following criteria: (a) Consolidated Leverage Ratio; (b) Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio; (c) Consolidated Tangible Net Worth; (d) Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio; (e) Consolidated Unencumbered Leverage Ratio; (f) Consolidated Unencumbered Interest Coverage Ratio;  and (g) Secured Recourse Indebtedness.
The 2024 Credit Agreement requires us to add additional subsidiaries as guarantors in the event the value of the assets owned by the subsidiary guarantors falls below a certain threshold as set forth in the 2024 Credit Agreement. In the event of default, Bank of America has the right to terminate the commitment of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions under the 2024 Credit Agreement, and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and all interest accrued and unpaid thereon. The aggregate borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facility was $1,150,000,000 as of February 14, 2024.
The 2024 Credit Facility replaces the 2022 Credit Facility. The material terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement are qualified in their entirety by the agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Certain agents, arrangers and lenders to the 2024 Credit Facility, and their affiliates, have performed and may in the future perform commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and advisory services for us and/or our affiliates from time to time for which they have received and may in the future receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.

EXHIBIT 99.1      Contact:   Alan Peterson        VP, Investor Rela�ons & Finance        (949) 270-9200        investorrela�ons@ahcreit.com    American Healthcare REIT Amends Credit Facility and   Provides Update on Key Post-Offering Ini�a�ves    IRVINE, Calif., February 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- American Healthcare REIT, Inc. (NYSE: AHR)  announced today that it has amended its exis�ng credit facility, extending its maturity date and  increasing its size to up to $1,150,000,000. The credit facility consists of an unsecured revolving  credit facility in the ini�al aggregate amount of $600,000,000 and an unsecured term loan  facility in the ini�al aggregate amount of $550,000,000. The revolving por�on of the credit  facility now matures on February 14, 2028, and may be extended for one 12-month period,  subject to certain condi�ons, and the term loan por�on of the facility matures on January 19,  2027. The amended credit facility will allow for increased flexibility as the company evaluates  opportuni�es, while maintaining the strength of its capital structure since its recently  completed underwriten public offering of common stock and the lis�ng of its common stock on  the New York Stock Exchange.   “We are pleased with the new terms of our credit facility with our lending partners,” said Danny  Prosky, President and Chief Execu�ve Officer of American Healthcare REIT. “We believe this  credit facility will benefit our stockholders and allow us to con�nue to grow our diverse por�olio  of healthcare real estate assets.”  Post-Offering Update  The company also announced progress it has made since its recently completed underwriten  public offering of common stock and lis�ng on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month.  Since the closing of the offering on February 9, 2024, the company has repaid approximately  $721 million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.53%. As of February  16, 2024, the company had $747,000,000 of outstanding balances on its lines of credit and term  loan, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.91% (taking into account the effect of swap  instruments), and $803,000,000 of aggregate availability under its lines of credit and term loan.
This significant reduc�on in outstanding debt has resulted in a meaningful improvement in the  company’s leverage metrics and will result in approximately $54 million in interest expense  savings on an annualized basis.  On por�olio performance, the company reported updated occupancies for its important  Integrated Senior Health Campuses and Senior Housing Opera�ng Por�olio (SHOP) segments  that showed con�nued growth. As of February 9, 2024, occupancy for the company’s same- store Integrated Senior Health Campuses was 87.6%, up from 86.6% for the three months  ended September 30, 2023, while occupancy for the company’s same-store SHOP was 82.6%,  up substan�ally from 78.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total occupancies  for the company’s Integrated Senior Health Campuses and SHOP segments as of February 9,  2024 were 87.3% and 82.7%, respec�vely. Occupancy for the company’s Medical Office Building  segment was 88.9%, down slightly from 89.7% as of September 30, 2023 due to an�cipated  tenant vacancies.  “We have con�nued to make good progress on key ini�a�ves since our recent equity offering  and lis�ng,” Mr. Prosky said. “The reduc�on in outstanding debt not only strengthens our  balance sheet but also provides substan�al interest expense savings in today’s heightened  interest rate environment. We expect that our strengthened balance sheet coupled with strong  por�olio performance, driven by our senior housing investments, will posi�on the company well  to grow value for our stockholders.”  Recent Transac�on Ac�vity  In February 2024, the company closed on the acquisi�on of a senior housing por�olio in Oregon  consis�ng of 856 beds across 12 campuses. The total considera�on consisted of $94.5 million of  assumed debt, plus closing costs, reflec�ng a price per bed of approximately $110,000. The  assumed debt has a fixed interest rate of 4.54% and matures on January 1, 2028. The por�olio  will be managed by Compass Senior Living through a RIDEA structure. The company has a  longstanding rela�onship with Compass Senior Living in its senior housing–leased por�olio and  recognized the strength of the operator through the COVID-19 pandemic. The management  agreement will be the company’s first with Compass Senior Living expanding the company’s  high-quality operator rela�onships.  About American Healthcare REIT, Inc.
