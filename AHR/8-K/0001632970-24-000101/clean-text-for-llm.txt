2 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this presentation, including statements relating to American Healthcare REIT, Inc.’s (the ”Company,” “its,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or  “AHR”) expectations regarding its portfolio growth, interest expense savings, balance sheet, net income (loss) per share, FFO per share, NFFO per share, total  portfolio Same-Store NOI growth, segment-level Same-Store NOI growth, occupancy, NOI growth, revenue growth, and margin expansion may be considered  forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of  1934, as amended. The Company intends for all such forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions for forward-looking  statements contained in those acts. Such forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,”  “will,” “can,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “continue,” “possible,” “initiatives,” “focus,” “seek,” “objective,” “goal,” “strategy,” “plan,”  “potential,” “potentially,” “preparing,” “projected,” “future,” “long-term,” “once,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “might,” “uncertainty,” or other similar words. Readers  are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date this presentation. Any such forward-looking  statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which the Company operates and beliefs of, and  assumptions made by, the Company's management and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially  from those expressed or implied therein, including, without limitation, risks disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports as filed with the Securities and  Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements  contained in this presentation. NON-GAAP MEASURES The Company’s reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company also discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA,  Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO, NFFO, NOI and Same-Store NOI. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental measures  of its operating performance and used by investors and analysts to compare the operating performance of the Company between periods and to other REITs  or companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items. Definitions of the non-GAAP  financial measures used herein and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP can be found at  the end of this presentation. See below for further information regarding the Company's non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Management uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate internal and external  comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used by investors, lenders, credit  and equity analysts in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are utilized by  our Board of Directors to evaluate management. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) or cash flows provided from operating  activities as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, EBITDA and  Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other REITs or other companies. DISCLAIMERS 2
3 Funds from Operations (FFO) and Normalized Funds from Operations (NFFO) We believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a further  understanding of our operating performance to investors, industry analysts and our management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on  our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be  immediately apparent from net income (loss). However, FFO and NFFO should not be construed to be (i) more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP  methodology in calculating net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance, (ii) more relevant or accurate than GAAP cash flows from  operations as an indicator of our liquidity or (iii) indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our  stockholders. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of  operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and NFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and  NFFO. Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors, industry analysts and management as they compare the  operating performance metrics used by the REIT industry, although it should be noted that some REITs may use different methods of calculating funds from  operations and normalized funds from operations, so comparisons with such REITs may not be meaningful. Net Operating Income (NOI) We believe that NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are appropriate supplemental performance measures to reflect the performance of  our operating assets because NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI exclude certain items that are not associated with the operations of the  properties. We believe that NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are widely accepted measures of comparative operating performance in  the real estate community. However, our use of the terms NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI may not be comparable to that of other real  estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing these amounts. NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI are not equivalent to our net income (loss) as determined under GAAP and may not be a useful measure  in measuring operational income or cash flows. Furthermore, NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be considered as alternatives  to net income (loss) as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity. NOI, Cash  NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the GAAP methodology in calculating net income  (loss). NOI, Cash NOI, Pro-Rata Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our  performance. DEFINED TERMS Certain defined terms used herein are defined in the Appendix. FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OTHER INFORMATION Unless otherwise indicated herein, the financial results and other information included in this presentation are based on the financial results and information  disclosed on August 5, 2024 in the Company’s Second Quarter 2024 earnings release, Second Quarter 2024 supplemental information package or subsequent  earnings conference call held on August 6, 2024, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at  www.americanhealthcarereit.com.
