Forward-Looking Statements
This 8-K includes forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies,
anticipated results from operations and developments and other matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements include,
among other things, statements regarding our and our officers’ intent, belief or expectation as identified by the use of phrases
or words such as “assume,” “may,” “will,” “project,” “expect,” “believe,”
“intend,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “target,” “forecast,” “plan,”
“line-of-sight,” “outlook,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “estimate,” “could,”
“would,” “should” and other comparable and derivative terms or the negatives thereof.
Forward-looking statements are based on management’s
beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events. You should not put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which are not a guarantee of performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events
or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We do not undertake a duty to update
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We urge you to carefully review the disclosures
we make concerning risks and uncertainties that may affect our business and future financial performance, including those made below and
in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as in the sections titled “Cautionary Statements—Summary
Risk Factors,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and our subsequent Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.
Certain factors that could affect our future results
and our ability to achieve our stated goals include, but are not limited to: (a) our exposure and the exposure of our managers, tenants
and borrowers to complex and evolving governmental policy, laws and regulations, including relating to healthcare, data privacy, cybersecurity
and environmental matters, the impact of such policies, laws and regulations on our and our managers’, tenants’ international
trade and borrowers’ business and the challenges and expense associated with complying with such policies, laws and regulations;
(b) the impact of market, macroeconomic, general economic conditions and fiscal policy on us, our managers, tenants and borrowers
and in areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, including changes in or elevated inflation, interest rates and exchange
rates, labor market dynamics and rises in unemployment, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit or capital,
events that affect consumer confidence, our occupancy rates and resident fee revenues, and the actual and perceived state of the real
estate markets and public and private capital markets; (c) the potential for significant general and commercial claims, legal actions,
investigations, regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions that could subject us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to increased
operating costs, uninsured liabilities, including fines and other penalties, reputational harm or significant operational limitations,
including the loss or suspension of or moratoriums on accreditations, licenses or certificates of need, suspension of or nonpayment for
new admissions, denial of reimbursement, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs or
the closure of facilities or communities; (d) our reliance on third-party managers and tenants to operate or exert substantial control
over properties they manage for, or rent from, us, which limits our control and influence over such properties, their operations and their
performance; (e) our reliance and the reliance of our managers, tenants and borrowers on the financial, credit and capital markets
and the risk that those markets may be disrupted or become constrained; (f) our ability, and the ability of our managers, tenants
and borrowers, to navigate the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate, including their
ability to respond to the impact of the U.S. political environment on government funding and reimbursement programs, and the financial
condition or business prospect of our managers, tenants and borrowers; (g) our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies
from, and effectively integrate, our completed or anticipated acquisitions and investments; (h) the risk of bankruptcy, inability
to obtain benefits from governmental programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our managers, tenants borrowers and other obligors
which may, among other things, have an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to make payments or meet their other obligations
to us, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (i) the risk that the borrowers under
our loans or other investments default or that, to the extent we are able to foreclose or otherwise acquire the collateral securing our
loans or other investments, we will be required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection therewith, that the assets will
underperform expectations or that we may not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets on favorable terms; (j) our
current and future amount of outstanding indebtedness, and our ability to access capital and to incur additional debt which is subject
to our compliance with covenants in instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness; (k) risks related
to the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges which are inherently uncertain and may increase or decrease
in the future and may not represent or reflect the ultimate value of, or loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant
assets, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (l) the risk that our management
agreements or leases are not renewed or are renewed on less favorable terms, that our managers or tenants default under those agreements
or that we are unable to replace managers or tenants on a timely basis or on favorable terms, if at all; (m) our ability to identify
and consummate future investments in, or dispositions of, healthcare assets and effectively manage our portfolio opportunities and our
investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures and minority interests, including our ability to dispose of such assets on favorable
terms as a result of rights of first offer or rights of first refusal in favor of third parties; (n) risks related to development,
redevelopment and construction projects, including costs associated with inflation, rising or elevated interest rates, labor conditions
and supply chain pressures, and risks related to increased construction and development in markets in which our properties are located,
including adverse effect on our future occupancy rates; (o) our ability to attract and retain talented employees; (p) the limitations
and significant requirements imposed upon our business as a result of our status as a REIT and the adverse consequences (including the
possible loss of our status as a REIT) that would result if we are not able to comply with such requirements; (q) the ownership limits
contained in our certificate of incorporation with respect to our capital stock in order to preserve our qualification as a REIT, which
may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company; (r) increases in our borrowing costs as a result of becoming more
leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions or other investment activity and rising or elevated interest rates; (s) our
exposure to various operational risks, liabilities and claims from our operating assets; (t) our dependency on a limited number of
managers and tenants for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; (u) our exposure to particular risks due to
our specific asset classes and operating markets, such as adverse changes affecting our specific asset classes and the healthcare real
estate sector, the competitiveness or financial viability of hospitals on or near the campuses where our outpatient medical buildings
are located, our relationships with universities, the level of expense and uncertainty of our research tenants, and the limitation of
our uses of some properties we own that are subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements; (v) our ability
to maintain a positive reputation for quality and service with our key stakeholders; (w) the availability, adequacy and pricing of
insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our managers, tenants, borrowers or other counterparties; (x) the
risk of exposure to unknown liabilities from our investments in properties or businesses; (y) the occurrence of cybersecurity threats
and incidents that could disrupt our or our managers’, tenants’ or borrower’s operations, result in the loss of confidential
or personal information or damage our business relationships and reputation; (z) the failure to maintain effective internal controls,
which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition; (aa) the impact of merger, acquisition and investment activity
in the healthcare industry or otherwise affecting our managers, tenants or borrowers; (bb) disruptions to the management and operations
of our business and the uncertainties caused by activist investors; (cc) the risk of catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural
events and the physical effects of climate change; (dd) the risk of potential dilution resulting from future sales or issuances of our
equity securities; and (ee) the other factors set forth in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
