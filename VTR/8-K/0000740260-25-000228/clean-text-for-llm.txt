Ventas Reports 2025 Second Quarter Results
CHICAGO
–
Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.
CEO Remarks
“The Company delivered strong earnings growth in the second quarter, led by powerful organic and external growth in our Senior Housing Operating Portfolio,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.
“We are experiencing an unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing driven by secular demand from a large and growing aging population, historically low new supply and an attractive product offering that is valuable to seniors.  Our advantaged platform enables us to drive performance in our existing communities and make compelling investments in senior housing.
“We continue to execute on our 1-2-3 strategy to create value for stockholders.  We are pleased to update and improve our full year guidance and increase our expected 2025 investment volume,” Cafaro concluded.
Second Quarter and Other 2025 Highlights
•
Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Attributable Net Income”) per share of $0.15
•
Normalized Funds From Operations* (“Normalized FFO”) per share of $0.87, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year
•
Total Company Net Operating Income* (“NOI”) year-over-year growth of 14% and Total Company Same-Store Cash NOI* year-over-year growth of 7%
•
On a Same-Store Cash NOI* basis, the senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”) grew 13% year-over-year, with cash operating revenue growth of 8% and NOI margin growth of 130 basis points
•
Year to date, the Company closed $1.1 billion of senior housing investments with attractive financial return expectations, consistent with its stated investment criteria and Right Market, Right Asset, Right Operator

strategy
•
Year to date, the Company has settled 16.4 million shares of common stock under outstanding forward sales agreements for gross proceeds of $1.1 billion and currently has $0.7 billion of unsettled equity forward sales agreements outstanding

External Growth Focused on Senior Housing

Financial Strength and Flexibility

Improved Full Year 2025 Guidance
The Company is increasing its guidance for the full year.
The Company’s 2025 guidance contains forward-looking statements and is based on a number of assumptions, including those identified later in this press release; actual results may differ materially.
Ventas expects to report 2025 per share Attributable Net Income to common stockholders, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO within the following ranges:
As of 5/28/25
As of 7/30/2025
Attributable Net Income Per Share Range

Normalized FFO Per Share Midpoint*
$3.41
$3.44
Full Year 2025 Guidance Commentary Update
The Company’s full year guidance for 2025 Normalized FFO per share is composed primarily of: (1) the benefit of (a) NOI growth in the Company’s SHOP segment and (b) accretive senior housing investment activity in 2024 and expected in 2025, partially offset by (2) the impact of higher net interest expense and the dilutive impact of a higher share price. The Company guidance includes completion of $2.0 billion in 2025 investments, with future investments expected to be funded primarily with its existing unsettled forward equity commitments. Certain additional assumptions are set forth in the appendix.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders (“Normalized FFO”) to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance across periods on a consistent basis. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
Nareit Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Normalized FFO”)
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) gains and losses on derivatives, net and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (b) the non-cash impact of income tax benefits or expenses; (c) gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net including the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (d) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (e) amortization of other intangibles; (f) the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; (h) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances; (i) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (j) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other normalizing items related to noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities; and (k) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

Adjusted EBITDA
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances), excluding (a) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; (b) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (c) noncontrolling interests’ share of adjusted EBITDA; (d) net gains or losses on real estate activity; (e) gains or losses on re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition; (f) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (g) gains or losses on derivatives, net and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; and including (x) Ventas’ share of adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (y) the impact of other items set forth in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
Further Adjusted EBITDA
Further Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for transactions and events that were completed during the period, as if the transaction or event had been consummated at the beginning of the relevant period and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Further Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, OM&R and NNN), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period.
Same-Store
The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its segment performance.
Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s OM&R and NNN reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Our SHOP and NNN that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by significant disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a significant disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for OM&R and NNN reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material

change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and NNN reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
Constant Currency
To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average monthly exchange rate for the current period.
