Ventas Reports 2024 Full Year Results, Provides 2025 Outlook and Increases Dividend
CHICAGO
–
Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024.
CEO Remarks
“Ventas delivered strong financial performance and growth in the fourth quarter and full year 2024 as we executed on our strategy to capture the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing. Our team delivered the third consecutive year of double-digit growth in our senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP) and completed over two billion dollars of accretive investments focused on senior housing that enhance our growth profile,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.
“We expect compelling demand for senior housing to continue because of the secular trend of a large and growing aging population, and supply to remain muted.
As a leading participant in the longevity economy, Ventas intends to use its advantaged platform to drive enterprise growth.
“We are introducing guidance for 2025 that builds on our momentum and increasing our quarterly dividend to common stockholders as a result of our strong results and positive outlook.
We are excited about the opportunities ahead to deliver value for all our stakeholders,” Cafaro concluded.

SHOP Growth
Average occupancy and revenue growth in the SHOP same-store portfolio exceeded expectations in 2024, contributing to same-store cash NOI growth of 15.8% in full year 2024 vs. 2023.

In the fourth quarter, the SHOP same-store portfolio outperformed historical seasonal trends and grew average occupancy by 310 basis points year-over-year.
Ventas OI
TM
active asset management initiatives, collaborative relationships with high performing operators and the favorable backdrop of demand growth in the 80+ population combined with limited new senior housing deliveries contributed to this outperformance.
External Growth Focused on Senior Housing
Ventas closed over $2 billion of investments focused primarily on senior housing in 2024. These senior housing investments are expected to generate attractive NOI yields, are priced below replacement cost and offer significant multiyear NOI growth potential, consistent with the Company’s stated investment criteria.
Ventas also has an active pipeline of attractive senior housing investments consistent with the Company’s investment criteria and intends to continue to expand its SHOP footprint and increase its enterprise growth.
Balance Sheet
Ventas’s Net Debt-to-Further Adjusted EBITDA* improved to 6.0x as of the end of the fourth quarter 2024 driven by SHOP segment growth and equity-funded senior housing investments, representing an improvement of 0.9x from year-end 2023. With this improvement, the Company has now entered its long term targeted range of 5.0x-6.0x.
Ventas Declares Quarterly Dividend of $0.48 Per Common Share, Representing 7% Increase
The Company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, representing a 7% increase, on the strength of the Company’s results and its positive outlook. The dividend will be payable in cash on April 17, 2025 to stockholders of record on March 31, 2025.

Full Year 2025 Guidance
The Company’s 2025 guidance contains forward-looking statements and is based on a number of assumptions; actual results may differ materially.
Ventas expects to report 2025 per share Attributable Net Income to common stockholders, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO within the following ranges:
As of 2/12/2025
Attributable Net Income Per Share Range
$0.42 - $0.53
Attributable Net Income Per Share Midpoint
$0.48
Nareit FFO Per Share Range*
$3.27 - $3.38
Nareit FFO Per Share Midpoint*
$3.33
Normalized FFO Per Share Range*
$3.35 - $3.46
Normalized FFO Per Share Midpoint*
$3.41
Full Year 2025 Guidance Commentary
In 2025, the Company expects to achieve significant NOI growth in the SHOP segment and to benefit from accretive senior housing investment activity.
The Company’s full year guidance for 2025 Attributable Net Income per share of $0.48 at the midpoint of the range compares to 2024 Attributable Net Income of $0.19.
The Company’s full year guidance for 2025 Normalized FFO per share of $3.41 at the midpoint of the range compares to 2024 Normalized FFO per share of $3.19.
The year-over-year projected increase of approximately 7% per share or $0.22 at the midpoint of the 2025 guidance range is composed primarily of: (1) the benefit of (a) NOI growth in the Company’s SHOP segment and (b) accretive senior housing investment activity in 2024 and expected in 2025, partially offset by (2) the impact of higher net interest expense, foreign exchange and the dilutive impact of a higher share price.
The Company has included approximately $1 billion of 2025 investments focused on senior housing in its 2025 guidance.

Certain factors that could affect our future results and our ability to achieve our stated goals include, but are not limited to: (a) our exposure and the exposure of our managers, tenants and borrowers to complex and evolving governmental policy, laws and regulations, including relating to healthcare, data privacy, cybersecurity and environmental matters, the impact of such policies, laws and regulations on our and our managers’, tenants’ and borrowers’ business and the challenges and expense associated with complying with such policies, laws and regulations; (b) the potential for significant general and commercial claims, legal actions, investigations, regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions that could subject us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to increased operating costs, uninsured liabilities, including fines and other penalties, reputational harm or significant operational limitations, including the loss or suspension of or moratoriums on accreditations, licenses or certificates of need, suspension of or nonpayment for new admissions, denial of reimbursement, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs or the closure of facilities or communities; (c) our reliance on third-party managers and tenants to operate or exert substantial control over properties they manage for, or rent from, us, which limits our control and influence over such properties, their operations and their performance; (d) the impact of market, macroeconomic, general economic conditions and fiscal policy on us, our managers, tenants and borrowers and in areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, including changes in or elevated inflation, interest rates and exchange rates, labor market dynamics, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit or capital, events that affect consumer confidence, our occupancy rates and resident fee revenues, and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets and public and private capital markets; (e) our reliance and the reliance of our managers, tenants and borrowers on the financial, credit and capital markets and the risk that those markets may be disrupted or become constrained; (f) our ability, and the ability of our managers, tenants and borrowers, to navigate the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate, including their ability to respond to the impact of the U.S. political environment on government funding and reimbursement programs, and the financial condition or business prospect of our managers, tenants and borrowers; (g) our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies from, and effectively integrate, our completed or anticipated acquisitions and investments; (h) the risk of bankruptcy, inability to obtain benefits from governmental programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our managers, tenants borrowers and other obligors which may, among other things, have an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to make payments or meet their other obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (i) the risk that the borrowers under our loans or other investments default or that, to the extent we are able to foreclose or otherwise acquire the collateral securing our loans or other investments, we will be required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection therewith, that the assets will underperform expectations or that we may not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets on favorable terms; (j) our current and future amount of outstanding indebtedness, and our ability to access capital and to incur additional debt which is subject to our compliance with covenants in instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness; (k) risks related to the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges which are inherently uncertain and may increase or decrease in the future and may not represent or reflect the ultimate value of, or loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant assets, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (l) the risk that our management agreements or leases are not renewed or are renewed on less favorable terms, that our managers or tenants default under those agreements or that we are unable to replace managers or tenants on a timely basis or on favorable terms, if at all; (m) our ability to identify and consummate future investments in, or dispositions of, healthcare assets and effectively manage our portfolio opportunities and our investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures and minority interests, including our ability to dispose of such assets on favorable terms as a result of rights of first offer or rights of first refusal in favor of third parties; (n) risks related to development, redevelopment and construction projects, including costs associated with inflation, rising or elevated interest rates, labor conditions and supply chain pressures, and risks related to increased construction and development in markets in which our properties are located, including adverse effect on our future occupancy rates; (o) our ability to attract and retain talented employees; (p) the limitations and significant requirements imposed upon our business as a result of our status as a REIT and the adverse consequences (including the possible loss of our status as a REIT) that would result if we are not able to comply with such requirements;

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders (“Normalized FFO”) to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
Nareit Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Normalized FFO”)
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) gains and losses on derivatives, net and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (b) the non-cash impact of income tax benefits or expenses; (c) gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net including the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (d) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (e) amortization of other intangibles; (f) the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; (h) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances; (i) non-cash charges related to leases; (j) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (k) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other normalizing items related to noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities; and (l) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily related to shareholder relations matters and certain legal matters.
The Company believes that Net debt and Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA are useful to investors, analysts and Company management because they allow the comparison of the Company’s credit strength between periods and to other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period.

Adjusted EBITDA
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances), excluding (a) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; (b) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (c) noncontrolling interests’ share of adjusted EBITDA; (d) net gains or losses on real estate activity; (e) gains or losses on re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition; (f) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (g) gains or losses on derivatives, net and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; and (i) non-cash charges related to leases, and including (x) Ventas’ share of adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (y) the impact of other items set forth in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA
Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA considers the pro forma effect on Adjusted EBITDA of transactions and events that were completed during the period, as if the transaction or event had been consummated at the beginning of the relevant period and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, OM&R and NNN), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period.
Same-Store
The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its segment performance.
Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s OM&R and NNN reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Our SHOP and NNN that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by significant disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a significant disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for OM&R and NNN reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may

require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and NNN reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
Constant Currency
To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average monthly exchange rate for the current period.
