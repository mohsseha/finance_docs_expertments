CEO Remarks
“Ventas delivered another strong quarter executing on our focused strategy to capture the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.
“We drove occupancy and revenue outperformance and double-digit NOI growth in our senior housing operating portfolio, supported by broad-based demand.
“We also have closed or placed under contract $1.7 billion of senior housing investments year to date.  This accelerating activity underscores our ability to capture value-creating opportunities in senior housing, and to meaningfully expand our participation in the multiyear senior housing growth opportunity.
“As a result of our momentum, we are updating and improving our full year guidance,” Cafaro concluded.

Delivering Profitable Organic Growth in Senior Housing
The third quarter SHOP Same-Store portfolio grew average occupancy by 350 basis points year-over-year.  When combined with rate growth, total revenue grew 8.7%. The SHOP Same-Store portfolio delivered year-over-year Same-Store Cash NOI growth of over 15% in the third quarter.
Third quarter average occupancy growth in the SHOP Same-Store portfolio was led by the U.S. at 400 basis points year-over-year.  Canada average occupancy grew 200 basis points year-over-year, reaching a new record of 96.5% in the third quarter.
External Growth Opportunities Focused on Senior Housing
Ventas has closed or placed under contract $1.7 billion of senior housing investments year to date. These senior housing investments are expected to generate attractive NOI yields, are priced below replacement cost, and offer significant multiyear NOI growth potential consistent with the Company’s investment criteria.  The Company intends to continue to build on its investment momentum to capture value-creating opportunities in senior housing and meaningfully expand its participation in the multiyear senior housing growth opportunity.
Financial Strength and Flexibility
Ventas’s long-term success is supported by its scale, strong liquidity and access to multiple sources of attractive capital. Net Debt-to-Further Adjusted EBITDA* improved to 6.3x at the end of the third quarter led by SHOP organic growth and equity-funded senior housing investments, representing an improvement of 0.6x from year-end 2023.
Corporate Sustainability Leadership
In September, Ventas released its 2023-2024 Corporate Sustainability Report (“CSR”).   The report details the Company’s environmental, social and governance initiatives to support the growth and success of its business and to advance its vital mission of helping a large and rapidly growing aging population live longer, healthier, happier lives. Ventas continues to earn global recognition for sustainability leadership and accomplishments, including distinction as the #1 Listed Healthcare REIT in the GRESB global ESG real estate assessment since 2017 and ENERGY STAR ® Partner of the Year in Energy Management for four consecutive years, with the Sustained Excellence designation for the second consecutive year.

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.
Nareit Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (b) amortization of other intangibles; (c) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances; (d) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (e) the non-cash impact of income tax benefits or expenses; (f) the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan; (g) non-cash charges related to leases; (h) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (i) gains and losses on derivatives and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (j) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other normalizing items related to noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities; (k) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; and (l) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

Includes adjustments for unusual items, including approximately $0.3 million and $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily related to the settlement by one of our operators of class action litigation in our SHOP segment.
The Company believes that Net debt and Further Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors, analysts and Company management because they allow the comparison of the Company’s credit strength between periods and to other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period.
Adjusted EBITDA
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances), excluding (a) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; (b) noncontrolling interests’ share of adjusted EBITDA; (c)
- MORE -

transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (d) net gains or losses on real estate activity; (e) gains or losses on re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition; (f) gains or losses on derivatives and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (g) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; and (i) non-cash charges related to leases, and including (x) Ventas’ share of adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (y) the impact of other items set forth in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
Further Adjusted EBITDA
Further Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for transactions and events that were completed during the period, as if the transaction or event had been consummated at the beginning of the relevant period and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Further Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period.
Same-Store
The Company defines Same-Store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the Same-Store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its segment performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in Same-Store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in Same-Store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in Same-Store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
