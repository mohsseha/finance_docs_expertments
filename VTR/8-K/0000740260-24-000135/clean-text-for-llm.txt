Ventas Reports 2024 First Quarter Results
CHICAGO
– (BUSINESS WIRE) –
Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.
CEO Remarks
“2024 is off to a strong start, led by continued organic growth in our advantaged senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”), as we execute against our strategy.
Demand-driven accelerating occupancy in SHOP drove our performance in the quarter, as the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing continues to build,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.
“Our business is well positioned to create value as we enable exceptional environments that serve the needs of a large and growing aging population. As a result of the durable strength of our enterprise and strong start to the year, we are updating and improving our guidance for the full year,” Cafaro concluded.
First Quarter and Other 2024 Highlights
•
Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Net Loss”) per share of ($0.04)
•
Normalized Funds From Operations* (“Normalized FFO”) per share of $0.78, an increase of over 5% compared to the prior year
•
Total Company Net Operating Income* (“NOI”) year-over-year growth of 8.2% and Total Company Same-Store Cash NOI* year-over-year growth of 6.7%
•
On a Same-Store Cash NOI* basis, SHOP grew more than 15% year-over-year led by the U.S. which grew approximately 18% year-over-year. SHOP Same-Store average occupancy growth accelerated to +240 basis points year-over-year and, combined with RevPOR growth, delivered year-over-year NOI margin expansion
•
Year to date, the Company completed several successful capital markets refinancing transactions. In March, Ventas raised Cdn$650 million 5.10% Senior Notes due 2029 and, in April, Ventas extended to 2028 its $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at improved pricing
•
Year to date, the Company closed or is under contract on approximately $350 million of investments focused on senior housing, meeting its previously stated full year investment expectations
•
Year to date, the Company issued 2.1 million shares of common stock under its at-the-market program for gross proceeds of $94 million.  Proceeds have match funded the senior housing investments completed year to date

Delivering Profitable Organic Growth in Senior Housing
First quarter average occupancy in the SHOP Same-Store portfolio grew 240 basis points year-over-year,  accelerating from growth of 170 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 120 basis points in full year 2023.
Strong demand resulted in elevated move-ins, and first quarter average occupancy outperformed normal seasonal patterns. Tour volumes throughout the first quarter and in April were consistently above prior year levels.
External Growth Opportunities Focused on Senior Housing
Ventas has closed or is under contract on its previously stated full year investment expectations of approximately $350 million focused on senior housing. These senior housing investments exhibit attractive going-in NOI yields with significant NOI growth potential, and priced at below replacement cost, in line with the Company’s investment criteria.
Financial Strength and Flexibility
Ventas’s long-term success is supported by its scale, strong liquidity and access to multiple sources of attractive capital.  As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $3.4 billion in liquidity, including availability under its unsecured revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, with no borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program.
Sustainability Leadership
Ventas received the 2024 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence in Energy Management Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), continuing the Company’s strong track record of recognition for its industry-leading corporate sustainability practices that support long-term value creation. This recognition marks Ventas’s second consecutive year earning ENERGY STAR’s highest honor and its fourth consecutive year winning the Partner of the Year Award. More than 175 Ventas-owned buildings received ENERGY STAR certification in 2023, the most certified properties of any healthcare REIT.

(s) increases in our borrowing costs as a result of becoming more leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions or other investment activity and rising or elevated interest rates; (t) our reliance on third-party managers and tenants to operate or exert substantial control over properties they manage for or rent from us, which limits our control and influence over such operations and results; (u) our exposure to various operational risks, liabilities and claims from our operating assets; (v) our dependency on a limited number of tenants and managers for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; (w) our exposure to particular risks due to our specific asset classes and operating markets, such as adverse changes affecting our specific asset classes and the real estate industry, the competitiveness or financial viability of hospitals on or near the campuses where our outpatient medical buildings are located, our relationships with universities, the level of expense and uncertainty of our research tenants, and the limitation of our uses of some properties we own that are subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements;

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.
Nareit Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs, including transaction, integration and restructuring-related costs and expenses, and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and including Ventas’ share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period.
Same-Store
The Company defines Same-Store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the Same-Store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its segment performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in Same-Store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in Same-Store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in Same-Store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
Properties are excluded from Same-Store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
Constant Currency
To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
