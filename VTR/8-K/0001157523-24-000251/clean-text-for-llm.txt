Ventas Reports 2023 Full Year Results and Provides 2024 Outlook
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 14, 2024--Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.
CEO Remarks
“Ventas delivered strong growth in the fourth quarter and full year 2023, fueled by property performance. We are pleased to have achieved consecutive years of significant organic growth in our senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”), led
by our U.S. communities and complemented by compounding contributions from our Outpatient Medical & Research portfolio,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.
“We expect unprecedented demand for senior housing in 2024 and subsequent years because of the rapidly growing senior population and the value our communities provide to residents and their families. We are focused on leveraging our
differentiated platform to drive continued organic SHOP performance and investing in senior housing to expand our participation in the compelling multiyear growth opportunity that is underway.
“Accelerating demographic demand is driving advantaged growth from our portfolio. We are optimistic about the future and committed to delivering continued strong performance and value for shareholders while enabling exceptional environments
that benefit the large and growing aging population,” Cafaro concluded.

A description of full year 2023 results is as follows:
2023 Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Stockholders per share increased $0.02 compared to 2022. Results in 2022 included a $53 million ($0.13 per share) benefit from HHS grants received and a $9 million ($0.02 per share) benefit of
promote revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 within the Company’s third-party institutional capital management business.
2023 Nareit Funds From Operations* (“Nareit FFO”) per share increased $0.44 year-over-year, or approximately 16%, driven by valuation-related increases in connection with taking ownership of the Equitized Loan Portfolio and unrealized
gains on warrants of Brookdale Senior Living common stock.
Normalized Funds from Operations* (“Normalized FFO”) per share in 2023 was $2.99, an increase of over 5% compared to the prior year excluding the HHS grants and promote revenue discussed above. Fourth quarter 2023 Normalized FFO also
included an estimated ($0.01) per share impact of a cybersecurity incident at Ardent Health Services (“Ardent”) in which the Company holds a 7.5% ownership interest.
2023 Total Company Net Operating Income* (“NOI”) increased year-over-year by 4.5% and Total Company Same-Store Cash NOI* was 8.1% higher year-over-year. On a Same-Store Cash NOI* basis, SHOP grew 18.3% year-over-year.
2023 Full Year Highlights
SHOP Occupancy Growth Accelerated:
Average occupancy year-over-year growth in the SHOP same-store portfolio accelerated in the fourth quarter due to demand strength, growing 170 basis points. Average occupancy grew 120 basis points
in 2023 versus 2022, exceeding guidance for average occupancy growth of approximately 110 basis points. With favorable supply/demand conditions combined with the implementation of the Ventas OI
TM
active asset management playbook,
the Company believes it is well positioned to benefit from an unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing.
Attractive Capital Markets Activity
: The Company raised over $4 billion of attractively priced capital ahead of rising interest rates, including proactively addressing 2024 debt maturities, strengthening the balance sheet and
enhancing liquidity. This demonstrates the advantages of Ventas’s size, scale and access to diverse forms of capital.
Successful Execution of Equitized Loan Portfolio Transaction:
Ventas successfully took ownership of and integrated the collateral for the “Santerre” mezzanine loan. The initial $486 million mezzanine loan investment yielded an 11%
unlevered IRR through the date Ventas took ownership of the portfolio, based on third-party appraised values. Ventas continues to implement asset management initiatives designed to maximize NOI and value of the assets.
TSR Outperformance Compared to Key Benchmarks over Short- and Long-Term:
Ventas’s 2023 total shareholder return (“TSR”) exceeding 15% continues the Company’s strong track record of performance.
1- and 2-year annualized TSR outperformed the Nareit Healthcare REIT Index and MSCI US REIT Index
For the 3 years ended December 31, 2023 Ventas performed in the upper quartile of the Nareit Healthcare REIT Index
Annualized TSR of nearly 18% since the beginning of 2000 significantly outperformed the Nareit Healthcare REIT Index, MSCI US REIT Index and S&P 500
Ventas Sustainability & Governance Highlights:
In 2023, Ventas continued its long history of industry-leading corporate sustainability practices that support long-term value creation. Highlights include:
Significantly advancing toward achievement of the Company’s 2040 Net Zero Operational Carbon goal by creating and rolling out ~800 property-specific decarbonization roadmaps and incorporating decarbonization into its capital planning
processes
Earning the 2023 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence in Energy Management Award, the ENERGY STAR program’s highest honor, in addition to numerous other notable recognitions
Earning the Gold Award in Nareit’s annual Diversity, Equity & Inclusion awards – the Company’s fourth consecutive year being recognized
Continuing the Company’s longstanding Board-led shareholder engagement program in the Spring and the Fall, through which our Board invites the Company’s top 50 shareholders, representing >70% of outstanding shares, to engage and share
their perspectives
Full Year 2024 Guidance
The Company’s 2024 guidance contains forward-looking statements and is based on a number of assumptions; actual results may differ materially. Ventas expects to report 2024 per share Attributable Net Income to common stockholders, Nareit FFO
and Normalized FFO within the following ranges:

Full Year 2024 Guidance Commentary
Consistent with 2023, the Company expects significant property NOI growth, led by SHOP in 2024 based on favorable supply/demand fundamentals and the Company’s advantaged platform.
The Company’s full year guidance for 2024 Attributable Net Income per share of $0.06 at the midpoint of the range compares to 2023 Attributable Net Loss of ($0.10).
The Company’s full year guidance for 2024 Normalized FFO per share of $3.13 at the midpoint of the range compares to 2023 Normalized FFO per share of $2.99. The year-over-year increase of $0.14 or approximately 5% per share at the midpoint of
the 2024 guidance range assumes: (1) the 2024 benefit of $0.28 per share of property NOI growth primarily from the SHOP business partially offset by (2) the impact of higher interest expense approximating ($0.11) per share, and (3) the
approximately ($0.03) per share impact of 2023 capital recycling activities.
The Company’s guidance is based on the assumptions described above as well as other assumptions that are subject to change, many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these and other assumptions, the
Company’s expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results. Information regarding potential risks that could cause actual results to differ is set forth below and in our filings with the SEC.

completed or anticipated acquisitions and investments of properties, including our ownership of the properties included in our equitized loan portfolio; (b) our exposure and the exposure of our tenants, managers and borrowers to complex
healthcare and other regulation, including evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity and environmental matters, and the challenges and expense associated with complying with such regulation; (c) the potential for
significant general and commercial claims, legal actions, regulatory proceedings or enforcement actions that could subject us or our tenants, managers or borrowers to increased operating costs, uninsured liabilities, fines or significant
operational limitations, including the loss or suspension of or moratoriums on accreditations, licenses or certificates of need, suspension of or nonpayment for new admissions, denial of reimbursement, suspension, decertification or exclusion
from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs or the closure of facilities or communities; (d) the impact of market and general economic conditions on us, our tenants, managers and borrowers and in areas in which our properties are

occupancy rates and resident fee revenues, and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets, labor markets and public and private capital markets; (e) our reliance and the reliance of our tenants, managers and borrowers on the
financial, credit and capital markets and the risk that those markets may be disrupted or become constrained, including as a result of bank failures or concerns or rumors about such events, tightening of lending standards and reduced
availability of credit or capital; (f) the secondary and tertiary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the implementation and impact of regulations related to the CARES Act and
other stimulus legislation, including the risk that some or all of the CARES Act or other COVID-19 relief payments we or our tenants, managers or borrowers received could be recouped; (g) our ability, and the ability of our tenants, managers
and borrowers, to navigate the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate, and the financial condition or business prospect of our tenants, managers and borrowers; (h) the risk of bankruptcy,
inability to obtain benefits from governmental programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors which may, among other things, have an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to make

are able to foreclose or otherwise acquire the collateral securing our loans or other investments, we will be required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection therewith, that the assets will underperform expectations or that
we may not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets on favorable terms; (j) our current and future amount of outstanding indebtedness, and our ability to access capital and to incur additional debt which is subject to our
compliance with covenants in instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness; (k) the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges are inherently uncertain, may increase or decrease in the
future and may not represent or reflect the ultimate value of, or loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant assets, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (l) the
non-renewal of any leases or management agreement or defaults by tenants or managers thereunder and the risk of our inability to replace those tenants or managers on a timely basis or on favorable terms, if at all; (m) our ability to identify

loss of our status as a REIT) that would result if we are not able to comply with such requirements; (q) the ownership limits contained in our certificate of incorporation with respect to our capital stock in order to preserve our
qualification as a REIT, which may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company; (r) the risk of changes in healthcare law or regulation or in tax laws, guidance and interpretations, particularly as applied to REITs, that could
adversely affect us or our tenants, managers or borrowers; (s) increases in our borrowing costs as a result of becoming more leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions or other investment activity and rising or elevated interest
rates; (t) our reliance on third-party managers and tenants to operate or exert substantial control over properties they manage for or rent from us, which limits our control and influence over such operations and results; (u) our exposure to
various operational risks, liabilities and claims from our operating assets; (v) our dependency on a limited number of tenants and managers for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; (w) our exposure to particular risks
due to our specific asset classes and operating markets, such as adverse changes affecting our specific asset classes and the real estate industry, the competitiveness or financial viability of hospitals on or near the campuses where our

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many
industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate
supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of
REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by
excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar
assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of
other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across
periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified
non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.
Nareit Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from
sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs, including transaction, integration and restructuring-related costs
and expenses, and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and including Ventas’ share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment
and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c)
the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement and
non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on
non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO
reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be
considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in
accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the
consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

Excludes sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational, land parcels, and third-party capital management revenues.
The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with
those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without
duplication (i) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash
NOI reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period.
Same-store
The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that
otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its
segment performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both
periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped
properties in our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods
presented. Our senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full
period in both periods presented.
Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such
as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those
properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive
position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are
scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
Constant Currency
To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual
reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
