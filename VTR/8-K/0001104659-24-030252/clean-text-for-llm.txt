work of enhancing value for Ventas shareholders, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the Company’s growth and success.”

real estate and delivered significant value to shareholders,” said Mr. Shelton. “I thank the Ventas Board for their partnership
and congratulate Roxanne. Ventas is very well positioned for continued success as it advances its mission of enabling exceptional environments

and effectively integrate, our completed or anticipated acquisitions and investments of properties, including our ownership of the properties
included in our equitized loan portfolio; (b) our exposure and the exposure of our tenants, managers and borrowers to complex healthcare
and other regulation, including evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity and environmental matters, and

claims, legal actions, regulatory proceedings or enforcement actions that could subject us or our tenants, managers or borrowers to increased
operating costs, uninsured liabilities, fines or significant operational limitations, including the loss or suspension of or moratoriums
on accreditations, licenses or certificates of need, suspension of or nonpayment for new admissions, denial of reimbursement, suspension,
decertification or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs or the closure of facilities or communities; (d) the
impact of market and general economic conditions on us, our tenants, managers and borrowers and in areas in which our properties are geographically
concentrated, including macroeconomic trends and financial market events, such as bank failures and other events affecting financial institutions,
market volatility, increases in inflation, changes in or elevated interest and exchange rates, tightening of lending standards and reduced
availability of credit or capital, geopolitical conditions, supply chain pressures, rising labor costs and historically low unemployment,
events that affect consumer confidence, our occupancy rates and resident fee revenues, and the actual and perceived state of the real
estate markets, labor markets and public and private capital markets; (e) our reliance and the reliance of our tenants, managers
and borrowers on the financial, credit and capital markets and the risk that those markets may be disrupted or become constrained, including
as a result of bank failures or concerns or rumors about such events, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit
or capital; (f) the secondary and tertiary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations

ability, and the ability of our tenants, managers and borrowers, to navigate the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries
in which we or they operate, and the financial condition or business prospect of our tenants, managers and borrowers; (h) the risk
of bankruptcy, inability to obtain benefits from governmental programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers,
borrowers and other obligors which may, among other things, have an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to make payments or
meet their other obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (i) the
risk that the borrowers under our loans or other investments default or that, to the extent we are able to foreclose or otherwise acquire
the collateral securing our loans or other investments, we will be required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection
therewith, that the assets will underperform expectations or that we may not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets
on favorable terms; (j) our current and future amount of outstanding indebtedness, and our ability to access capital and to incur
additional debt which is subject to our compliance with covenants in instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness;
(k) the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges are inherently uncertain, may increase or decrease
in the future and may not represent or reflect the ultimate value of, or loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant
assets, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (l) the non-renewal of any leases
or management agreement or defaults by tenants or managers thereunder and the risk of our inability to replace those tenants or managers
on a timely basis or on favorable terms, if at all; (m) our ability to identify and consummate future investments in or dispositions

with respect to our capital stock in order to preserve our qualification as a REIT, which may delay, defer or prevent a change of control
of our company; (r) the risk of changes in healthcare law or regulation or in tax laws, guidance and interpretations, particularly
as applied to REITs, that could adversely affect us or our tenants, managers or borrowers; (s) increases in our borrowing costs as
a result of becoming more leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions or other investment activity and rising or elevated interest
rates; (t) our reliance on third-party managers and tenants to operate or exert substantial control over properties they manage for

risks, liabilities and claims from our operating assets; (v) our dependency on a limited number of tenants and managers for a significant
portion of our revenues and operating income; (w) our exposure to particular risks due to our specific asset classes and operating
