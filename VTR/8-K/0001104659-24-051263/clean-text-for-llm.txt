Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation
under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On April 24, 2024,
Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”), Ventas SSL Ontario II, Inc., Ventas Canada Finance Limited,
Ventas UK Finance, Inc. and Ventas Euro Finance, LLC,
as borrowers (collectively, the “Borrowers”), each of which is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Ventas, Inc. (the “Company”), and the Company, as guarantor, entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and
Guaranty Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”), with the lenders identified therein, Bank of America, N.A., as
Administrative Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Joint Bookrunners. The New Credit Agreement provides for a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit
Facility”).
The New Credit Agreement
replaces the Company’s existing $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility evidenced by that certain Third Amended and
Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2021 (as amended restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
from time to time), by and among the Borrowers, the Company, as guarantor, the lenders identified therein, Bank of America, N.A., as
Administrative Agent and Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Joint Bookrunners (the “Existing Credit
Agreement”).
Aggregate borrowing capacity under the New Credit
Agreement may be increased, at the Borrowers’ option, to up to $3.75 billion by increasing the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility
or by incurring additional term loans, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the New Credit Agreement,
including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase.
The Revolving Credit Facility includes sublimits
of (i) up to $200 million for letters of credit, (ii) up to $1.0 billion for loans in certain alternative currencies and for
certain multicurrency loans and (iii) up to 50% of the facility for certain negotiated rate loans.
The Borrowers’ obligations under the New
Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and rank equal in right of payment with all other senior unsecured obligations of the Borrowers
and the Company.
Borrowings outstanding under the New Credit Agreement
bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the applicable SOFR for SOFR rate loans and the highest of (i) the federal
funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the Administrative Agent’s prime rate and (iii) one-month Term SOFR plus 1.0% for base rate
loans, plus, in each case, a spread based on the long-term senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt rating of Ventas Realty (“Debt
Ratings”). Negotiated rate loans pursuant to the New Credit Agreement bear interest at the rate agreed to between the relevant Borrower
and the applicable lender. The Borrowers are also obligated to pay an annual facility fee on the aggregate commitments under the Revolving
Credit Facility based on Ventas Realty’s Debt Ratings. Based on Ventas Realty’s current Debt Ratings, the applicable spread
is 0.775% for SOFR rate loans and 0.00% for base rate loans, and the facility fee is 15 basis points.
The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 24,
2028, but may be extended, at the Borrowers’ option, for up to two additional periods of six months each, subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions set forth in the New Credit Agreement. Borrowings outstanding under the New Credit Agreement may be repaid from
time to time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs, if any, with respect to Term SOFR rate loans.
Except as set forth above, the terms of the New
Credit Agreement are substantially consistent with the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. In particular, the New Credit Agreement
imposes certain customary restrictions on the Borrowers, the Company and their subsidiaries, including restrictions pertaining to: (i) liens;
(ii) investments; (iii) the incurrence of additional indebtedness; (iv) mergers and dissolutions; (v) certain dividend,
distribution and other payments; (vi) permitted businesses; (vii) transactions with affiliates; and (viii) the maintenance
of certain consolidated total leverage, secured debt leverage, unsecured debt leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and minimum consolidated
adjusted net worth. The New Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If a default occurs and is continuing, the Borrowers
may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement.
The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the New Credit Agreement, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
The representations, warranties and covenants
contained in the New Credit Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different
from what might be viewed as material to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties. Accordingly,
the representations and warranties in the New Credit Agreement are not necessarily characterizations of the actual state of facts about
the Company, the Borrowers and their subsidiaries at the time they were made or otherwise and should be read only in conjunction with
the other information that the Company makes publicly available in reports, statements and other documents filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries of, and should not rely upon, such representations, warranties and
covenants.
