Item 3.03.
Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
The information contained in Item 5.03 of this
Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03.
Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual
Meeting”) of Ventas, Inc. (the “Company”) held on May 13, 2025, the Company’s stockholders approved
amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to increase the number of authorized shares
of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.25 per share, from 600,000,000 shares to 1,200,000,000 shares and to make a corresponding
change to the aggregate number of authorized shares of the Company’s capital stock (the “Authorized Share Amendment”)
and (ii) to provide for the elimination of monetary liability of certain of the Company’s officers in certain circumstances
as provided under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (the “DGCL”)
(the “Exculpation Amendment” and, together with the Authorized Share Amendment, the “Charter Amendments”). The
Exculpation Amendment also simplifies the existing exculpation provision related to the Company’s directors by referring to the
DGCL instead of specifying each instance in which exculpation for directors is currently not permissible under the DGCL. Following the
Annual Meeting, on May 14, 2025, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware Certificates of Amendments
to implement the Charter Amendments as well as a Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
The information set forth herein is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Certificates of Amendments to implement the Charter Amendments and the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, respectively, to this Current Report
on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein
.
Item 5.07.
Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
Represented at the Annual Meeting were 401,652,999
shares, or 91.76%, of the Company’s 437,697,802 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Proxies
for the Annual Meeting were solicited pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Set forth below
are the voting results for the proposals considered and voted upon at the Annual Meeting, all of which were described in the Company’s
definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2025, as supplemented on April 16,
2025 (the “Proxy Statement”). The vote required for approval of Proposals 1 and 4 was based on a majority of votes cast. The
vote required for Proposals 2 and 3 was based on a majority of voting power present (in person or by proxy). The vote required for Proposal
5 was based on the majority of shares outstanding entitled to vote on this matter. Abstentions had no effect on Proposals 1 and 4 and
were counted as votes “against” on Proposals 2, 3 and 5. Pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange governing
brokers’ discretionary authority, brokers did not have the authority to vote on Proposals 1 and 2 without the beneficial owner’s
instruction. Brokers had discretionary authority to vote on Proposals 3 and 4, and broker non-votes were counted as votes “against”
on Proposal 5.
Proposal 1: To elect the 12 director nominees named in the Proxy
Statement to serve until the 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
