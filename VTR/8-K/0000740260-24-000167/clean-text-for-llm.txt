Item 5.07.     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
The 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) of Ventas, Inc. (the “Company”) was held on May 14, 2024. Represented at the Annual Meeting were 371,713,165 shares, or 91.99%, of the Company’s 404,048,823 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Proxies for the Annual Meeting were solicited pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Set forth below are the voting results for the proposals considered and voted upon at the Annual Meeting, all of which were described in the Company’s definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 2, 2024 (the “Proxy Statement”). The vote required for approval of Proposal 1 is based on a majority of votes cast, while the vote required for Proposals 2 and 3 is based on a majority of shares present (in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote. Abstentions have no effect on Proposal 1 and are counted as “against” on Proposals 2 and 3. Pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange governing brokers’ discretionary authority, brokers did not have the authority to vote on Proposals 1 and 2 without the beneficial owner’s instruction.
Proposal 1:    To elect the 12 director nominees named in the Proxy Statement to serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
