Ventas Reports 2024 Second Quarter Results

CEO Remarks
“We started 2024 with momentum, which continued in the second quarter as we delivered another quarter of strong results.
We are executing on our focused strategy to capture the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.
“We drove occupancy and revenue growth in our senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”) to fuel our performance.
We also are expanding our SHOP footprint and our enterprise growth rate by investing in attractive senior housing opportunities.
Our financial strength has improved meaningfully year to date as a result of delivering profitable organic growth in SHOP, adding external investments focused on senior housing, and driving performance throughout our portfolio.
“We are pleased to again update and improve our guidance for the full year as we continue to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
“As a major participant in the longevity economy, Ventas is focused on enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population,” Cafaro concluded.
Second Quarter and Other 2024 Highlights
•
Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Attributable Net Income”) per share of $0.05
•
Normalized Funds From Operations* (“Normalized FFO”) per share of $0.80, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the prior year
•
Total Company Net Operating Income* (“NOI”) year-over-year growth of 6.9% and Total Company Same-Store Cash NOI* year-over-year growth of 7.8%
•
On a Same-Store Cash NOI* basis, SHOP grew 15.2% year-over-year and was led by occupancy growth of 320 basis points
•
Year to date, the Company closed approximately $350 million of investments focused on senior housing, with a large and growing pipeline of additional senior housing investment opportunities

Delivering Profitable Organic Growth in Senior Housing
The second quarter SHOP Same-Store portfolio benefited from average occupancy growth of 320 basis points year-over-year and rate growth, generating total revenue growth of 8.0%.
Second quarter average occupancy growth in the SHOP Same-Store portfolio was led by the U.S. at 380 basis points year-over-year.
Canada average occupancy grew 170 basis points year-over-year, approaching 96% in the second quarter.  All SHOP community types, geographies and operators experienced broad-based demand and strong sales execution, generating net move-ins consistently above prior year levels.
External Growth Opportunities Focused on Senior Housing
Ventas has closed on approximately $350 million of investments year to date focused on senior housing. These senior housing investments are generating going-in NOI yields approximating 8% and are priced below replacement cost, with significant multiyear NOI growth potential, in line with the Company’s investment criteria.
Investment activity has been fully funded by the Company’s year to date equity issuance of approximately $500 million.
The Company has a line of sight to additional investments focused on senior housing of approximately $400 million and intends to build on its investment momentum.
Financial Strength and Flexibility
Ventas’s long-term success is supported by its scale, strong liquidity and access to multiple sources of attractive capital.  As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $3.3 billion in liquidity, including availability under its unsecured revolving credit facility and $550 million of cash and cash equivalents.
•
Leverage continued to improve, led by SHOP organic growth and equity-funded senior housing investments.  Net Debt-to-Further Adjusted EBITDA* was 6.4x at the end of the second quarter, an improvement of 0.3x from the first quarter and 0.5x from year-end 2023.

bankruptcy, inability to obtain benefits from governmental programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors which may, among other things, have an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to make payments or meet their other obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (i) the risk that the borrowers under our loans or other investments default or that, to the extent we are able to foreclose or otherwise acquire the collateral securing our loans or other investments, we will be required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection therewith, that the assets will underperform expectations or that we may not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets on favorable terms; (j) our current and future amount of outstanding indebtedness, and our ability to access capital and to incur additional debt which is subject to our compliance with covenants in instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness;

(r) the risk of changes in healthcare law or regulation or in tax laws, guidance and interpretations, particularly as applied to REITs, that could adversely affect us or our tenants, managers or borrowers; (s) increases in our borrowing costs as a result of becoming more leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions or other investment activity and rising or elevated interest rates; (t) our reliance on third-party managers and tenants to operate or exert substantial control over properties they manage for, or rent from, us, which limits our control and influence over such operations and results;

(w) our exposure to particular risks due to our specific asset classes and operating markets, such as adverse changes affecting our specific asset classes and the real estate industry, the competitiveness or financial viability of hospitals on or near the campuses where our outpatient medical buildings are located, our relationships with universities, the level of expense and uncertainty of our research tenants, and the limitation of our uses of some properties we own that are subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements;

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.
Nareit Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (b) amortization of other intangibles; (c) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances; (d) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (e) the non-cash impact of income tax benefits or expenses; (f) the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan; (g) non-cash charges related to leases; (h) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (i) gains and losses on derivatives and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (j) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other normalizing items related to noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities; (k) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; and (l) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

The Company believes that Net debt and Further Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors, analysts and Company management because they allow the comparison of the Company’s credit strength between periods and to other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period.
Adjusted EBITDA
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances),

excluding (a) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; (b) noncontrolling interests’ share of adjusted EBITDA; (c) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (d) net gains or losses on real estate activity; (e) gains or losses on re-measurement of equity interest upon acquisition; (f) gains or losses on derivatives and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (g) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; and (i) non-cash charges related to leases, and including (x) Ventas’ share of adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (y) the impact of other items set forth in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
Further Adjusted EBITDA
Further Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for transactions and events that were completed during the period, as if the transaction or event had been consummated at the beginning of the relevant period and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Further Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period.
Same-Store
The Company defines Same-Store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that otherwise meet the Same-Store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its segment performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in Same-Store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in Same-Store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in Same-Store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
Properties are excluded from Same-Store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by significant disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a significant disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or
