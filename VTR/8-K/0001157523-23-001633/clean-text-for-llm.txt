Exhibit 99.1
Ventas Reports 2023 Third Quarter Results
CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 2, 2023--Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.
CEO Remarks
“Ventas delivered a strong third quarter, reflecting attractive property growth across all business segments,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and CEO.
“Consistent with our expectations, our senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”) led the way, with outstanding occupancy increases from the beginning to the end of the third quarter, across all geographies and product types, including
independent living. Move-ins were approximately 120% of 2019 levels, underscoring powerful demand trends and the benefits our communities offer to residents and their families. The senior housing multiyear growth and recovery cycle is in full
swing. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capture additional upside.
“Our high-quality diversified portfolio is unified in serving the needs of the nation’s large and growing aging population, which drives our momentum. Our Company is committed to delivering strong performance and value for shareholders. We
are pleased to update the outlook for Attributable Net Income and Nareit FFO per share and increase the midpoint of our Normalized FFO per share guidance for the full year,” Cafaro concluded.
Third Quarter 2023 Highlights
Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Net Loss”) per share of ($0.18), driven primarily, by the recognition of $73 million ($0.18 per share) of non-cash impairments on real estate assets held for sale as the Company continues to
recycle capital as part of its Right Market, Right Asset, Right Operator
™
strategy
Normalized Funds from Operations* (“Normalized FFO”) per share of $0.75, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year excluding $0.05 per share of HHS grants received in the third quarter of 2022
Total Company Net Operating Income* (“NOI”) year-over-year growth of 5.1% and Total Company Same-Store Cash NOI* year-over-year growth of 7.9%
On a Same-Store Cash NOI* basis, SHOP grew more than 18% year-over-year led by the U.S. which grew approximately 24% year-over-year and was complemented by the 95% occupied Canadian portfolio which grew 6% year-over-year. SHOP Same-Store
Cash NOI growth was driven by broad-based occupancy gains, RevPOR growth and moderating operating expense growth, which resulted in margin expansion of 230 basis points

impairment on real estate assets held for sale.
SHOP Occupancy Demonstrates Broad-Based Gains
Spot occupancy in the SHOP same-store portfolio accelerated, growing 180 basis points from June 30 to September 30. The occupancy growth was broad-based, led by demand strength across both the assisted living and independent living
portfolios. Third quarter average occupancy in the SHOP same-store portfolio increased sequentially by 130 basis points (vs. the second quarter 2023), and 110 basis points compared to the prior year period. With favorable demand/supply
conditions combined with implementation of the Ventas OI
™
active asset management playbook, the Company is well positioned to continue to benefit from an unprecedented multiyear growth and recovery cycle in senior housing.
Attractive Year-to-Date Capital Markets Activity
Ventas’s long-term success is supported by its scale, strong liquidity and access to multiple sources of attractive capital. Ahead of rising interest rates, the Company has raised approximately $2.8 billion year-to-date at cash interest
rates averaging approximately 4.9%, which has been used to proactively refinance 2023 and 2024 maturing debt and improve the Company’s floating rate debt exposure to 8% of total consolidated debt, while enhancing liquidity at September 30,
2023 to over $3 billion.

include, among others, statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated results from operations and developments and other matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements include, among other

Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Certain factors that could affect our future results and our ability to achieve our stated goals include, but are not limited to: (a) the impact and extended consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and other viruses and infections, such
as flu and respiratory syncytial virus, on our revenue, level of profitability, liquidity and overall risk exposure and the implementation and impact of regulations related to the CARES Act and other stimulus legislation and any future
COVID-19 relief measures, including the risk that some or all of the CARES Act or other COVID-19 relief payments we or our tenants, managers or borrowers received could be recouped; (b) our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and
synergies from, and effectively integrate, our completed or anticipated acquisitions and investments, including our ownership of the properties included in our equitized loan portfolio; (c) our exposure and the exposure of our tenants,
managers and borrowers to complex healthcare and other regulation and the challenges and expense associated with complying with such regulation; (d) the potential for significant general and commercial claims, legal actions, regulatory
proceedings or enforcement actions that could subject us or our tenants, managers or borrowers to increased operating costs, uninsured liabilities fines or significant operational limitations, including the loss or suspension of or
moratoriums on accreditations, licenses or certificates of need, suspension of new admissions, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs or the closure of facilities or communities; (e) the
impact of market and general economic conditions on us and our tenants, managers and borrowers, including economic and financial market events, such as bank failures and other events affecting financial institutions, market volatility,
increases in inflation, changes in interest rates and exchange rates, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit or capital, geopolitical conditions, supply chain pressures, rising labor costs and historically low
unemployment, events that affect consumer confidence, our occupancy rates and resident fee revenues, and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets, labor markets and public and private capital markets; (f) our reliance and
the reliance of our tenants, managers and borrowers on the financial, credit and capital markets and the risk that those markets may be disrupted or become constrained, including as a result of bank failures or concerns or rumors about such
events, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit or capital; (g) our ability, and the ability of our tenants, managers and borrowers, to navigate the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in
which we or they operate; (h) the risk of bankruptcy, inability to obtain benefits from governmental programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors which may, among other things, have
an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to pay obligations due to us or our financial results and financial condition; (i) the risk that the borrowers under our loans or other investments default or that, to the extent we are able
to foreclose or otherwise acquire the collateral securing our loans or other investments, we will be required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection therewith, that the assets will underperform expectations or that we may
not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets on favorable terms; (j) the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges are inherently uncertain, may increase or decrease in the future and may
not represent or reflect the ultimate value of, or loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant assets, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (k) the non-renewal of any
leases or management agreement or defaults by tenants or managers thereunder and the risk of our inability to replace those tenants or managers on favorable terms, if at all; (l) our ability to identify and consummate future investments in
or dispositions of healthcare assets and effectively manage our portfolio opportunities and our investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures and minority interests, including our ability to dispose of such assets on favorable terms

conditions and supply chain pressures; (n) our ability to attract and retain talented employees; (o) the limitations and significant requirements imposed upon our business as a result of our status as a REIT and the adverse consequences
(including the possible loss of our status as a REIT) that would result if we are not able to comply with such requirements; (p) the risk of changes in healthcare law or regulation or in tax laws, guidance and interpretations, particularly
as applied to REITs, that could adversely affect us or our tenants, managers or borrowers; (q) increases in our borrowing costs as a result of becoming more leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions or other investment activity
and rising interest rates; (r) our reliance on third parties to operate a majority of our assets and our limited control and influence over such operations and results; (s) our dependency on a limited number of tenants and managers for a
significant portion of our revenues and operating income; (t) the availability, adequacy and pricing of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, managers or other counterparties; (u) the occurrence
of cyber incidents that could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or damage our business relationships and reputation; (v) the impact of merger, acquisition and investment activity in the healthcare
industry or otherwise affecting our tenants, managers or borrowers; (w) disruptions to the management and operations of our business and the uncertainties caused by activist investors; (x) the risk of catastrophic or extreme weather and
other natural events and the physical effects of climate change; (y) the risk of potential dilution resulting from future sales or issuances of our equity securities; and (z) the other factors set forth in our periodic filings with the

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many
industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate
supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of
REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by
excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar
assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance
of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies
across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about
identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.
Nareit Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses)
from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction expenses and deal costs, including transaction, integration and severance-related costs and expenses,
and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and including Ventas’ share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation
allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash
effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement and non-cash
charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on
non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be
considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in
accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the
consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

Excludes sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational, land parcels and third-party management revenues.
The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and to compare its operating results with
those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments (i.e., SHOP, Outpatient Medical and Research Portfolio and Triple-Net), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i)
non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (ii) sold assets, assets held for sale, development properties not yet operational and land parcels and (iii) other items set forth in the Cash NOI
reconciliation included herein. In certain cases, results may be adjusted to reflect the receipt of cash payments, fees, and other consideration that is not fully recognized as NOI in the period.
Same-store
The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may include selected properties that
otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of its
segment performance. Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both
periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or
redeveloped properties in the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both
periods presented. SHOP and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods
presented.
Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such
as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for the outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments,
those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a
market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those
properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
Constant Currency
To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual
reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
