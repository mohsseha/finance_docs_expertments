Ventas Reports 2025 First Quarter Results
CHICAGO
– Ventas, Inc.
(NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.
CEO Remarks
“Ventas delivered a strong first quarter of 2025, as we
executed on our strategy to capitalize on the unprecedented multiyear growth opportunity in senior housing. We drove double-digit
growth in our senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP), which powered our first quarter results,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas
Chairman and CEO.
“Already this year, we have completed nearly all of our original
billion-dollar investment guidance in attractive SHOP investments designed to increase our forward enterprise growth rate. Our investment
pipeline continues to grow and we expect to close additional investments later this year.
“Benefitting from our attractive financial profile, secular
demand and experienced team, we are excited about the opportunities ahead to deliver value for all of our stakeholders from the multiyear
growth opportunity in senior housing and pleased to reaffirm our 2025 guidance,” Cafaro concluded.
First Quarter and Other 2025 Highlights
•
Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Attributable Net Income”) per share of $0.10
•
Normalized Funds From Operations* (“Normalized FFO”) per share of $0.84, an increase of approximately 8% compared to the
prior year
•
Total Company Net Operating Income* (“NOI”) year-over-year growth of approximately 13% and Total Company Same-Store Cash
NOI* year-over-year growth of approximately 7%
•
On a Same-Store Cash NOI* basis, the senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”) grew approximately 14% year-over-year,
with NOI margin growth of 150 basis points
•
Year to date, the Company closed approximately $900 million of investments focused on senior housing with attractive financial return
expectations, consistent with its stated financial criteria and Right Market, Right Asset, Right Operator
TM
strategy
•
Year to date, the Company entered into equity forward sales agreements under its at-the-market equity offering program for gross proceeds
of approximately $1.1 billion for 16.5 million shares of common stock and currently has approximately $0.4 billion of unsettled equity
forward sales agreements outstanding
•
In April 2025, Ventas increased its liquidity by expanding its unsecured credit facility by $750 million to an aggregate $3.5
billion. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had $2.9 billion in liquidity
*Some of the financial measures throughout this press release are non-GAAP
measures. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation tables at the end of this press release for additional information and

SHOP Growth
In the first quarter, SHOP Same-Store Cash NOI increased 13.6% year-over-year,
driven by revenue growth of 7.4%. SHOP same-store average occupancy grew 290 basis points year-over-year and was led by U.S. average occupancy
growth of 330 basis points. Successful SHOP operator collaboration and implementation of Ventas OI
TM
data science and asset
management initiatives contributed to RevPOR growth that exceeded expectations at +3.8% year-over-year, or +5.0% when adjusting for the
leap year impact in the prior year period.
External Growth Focused on Senior Housing
Ventas has closed approximately $900 million of investments focused
on senior housing year-to-date. These senior housing investments are expected to increase the Company’s growth rate on a multiyear
basis, generate attractive NOI yields, are priced below replacement cost and offer significant multiyear NOI growth potential, consistent
with the Company’s stated investment criteria.
Financial Strength and Flexibility
Ventas’s Net Debt-to-Further Adjusted EBITDA* improved to 5.7x
as of the end of the first quarter driven by SHOP segment growth and equity-funded senior housing investments, representing an improvement
of 0.3x from year-end 2024 and 1.0x compared to the first quarter of 2024.
In April 2025, Ventas increased the capacity of its unsecured
credit facility by $750 million to an aggregate $3.5 billion.

Reaffirming Full Year 2025 Guidance
The Company is reaffirming its guidance for the full year. The Company’s
2025 guidance contains forward-looking statements and is based on a number of assumptions, including the select assumptions identified
later in this press release in the appendix; actual results may differ materially. Ventas expects to report 2025 per share Attributable
Net Income to common stockholders, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO within the following ranges:
As of 2/12/25
As of 4/30/2025
Attributable Net Income Per Share Range
$0.42 - $0.53
$0.42 - $0.53
Attributable Net Income Per Share Midpoint

Nareit FFO Per Share Range*

Normalized FFO Per Share Range*
$3.35 - $3.46
$3.35 - $3.46
Normalized FFO Per Share Midpoint*
$3.41
$3.41
Full Year 2025 Guidance Commentary Update
The Company’s full year guidance for 2025 Normalized FFO per
share is composed primarily of: (1) the benefit of (a) NOI growth in the Company’s SHOP segment and (b) accretive
senior housing investment activity in 2024 and expected in 2025, partially offset by (2) the impact of higher net interest expense,
foreign exchange and the dilutive impact of a higher share price. The Company has increased its 2025 guidance for senior housing investment
volume to $1.5 billion, from $1 billion, with the incremental investments expected to be second half weighted and funded primarily with
its existing unsettled forward equity commitments and disposition proceeds.

Certain factors that could affect our future results and our ability
to achieve our stated goals include, but are not limited to: (a) our exposure and the exposure of our managers, tenants and borrowers
to complex and evolving governmental policy, laws and regulations, including relating to healthcare, data privacy, cybersecurity, international
trade and environmental matters, the impact of such policies, laws and regulations on our and our managers’, tenants’ and
borrowers’ business and the challenges and expense associated with complying with such policies, laws and regulations; (b) the
impact of market, macroeconomic, general economic conditions and fiscal policy on us, our managers, tenants and borrowers and in areas
in which our properties are geographically concentrated, including changes in or elevated inflation, interest rates and exchange rates,
labor market dynamics and rises in unemployment, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit or capital, events
that affect consumer confidence, our occupancy rates and resident fee revenues, and the actual and perceived state of the real estate
markets and public and private capital markets; (c) the potential for significant general and commercial claims, legal actions, investigations,
regulatory proceedings and enforcement actions that could subject us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to increased operating costs,
uninsured liabilities, including fines and other penalties, reputational harm or significant operational limitations, including the loss
or suspension of or moratoriums on accreditations, licenses or certificates of need, suspension of or nonpayment for new admissions, denial
of reimbursement, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs or the closure of facilities
or communities; (d) our reliance on third-party managers and tenants to operate or exert substantial control over properties they
manage for, or rent from, us, which limits our control and influence over such properties, their operations and their performance; (e) our
reliance and the reliance of our managers, tenants and borrowers on the financial, credit and capital markets and the risk that those
markets may be disrupted or become constrained; (f) our ability, and the ability of our managers, tenants and borrowers, to navigate
the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate, including their ability to respond to the
impact of the U.S. political environment on government funding and reimbursement programs, and the financial condition or business prospect
of our managers, tenants and borrowers; (g) our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies from, and effectively integrate,
our completed or anticipated acquisitions and investments; (h) the risk of bankruptcy, inability to obtain benefits from governmental
programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our managers, tenants borrowers and other obligors which may, among other things, have
an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to make payments or meet their other obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact
on our results of operations and financial condition; (i) the risk that the borrowers under our loans or other investments default
or that, to the extent we are able to foreclose or otherwise acquire the collateral securing our loans or other investments, we will be
required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection therewith, that the assets will underperform expectations or that we
may not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets on favorable terms; (j) our current and future amount of outstanding
indebtedness, and our ability to access capital and to incur additional debt which is subject to our compliance with covenants in instruments
governing our and our subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness; (k) risks related to the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit
losses or impairment charges which are inherently uncertain and may increase or decrease in the future and may not represent or reflect
the ultimate value of, or loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant assets, which could have an adverse impact on
our results of operations and financial condition; (l) the risk that our management agreements or leases are not renewed or are renewed
on less favorable terms, that our managers or tenants default under those agreements or that we are unable to replace managers or tenants
on a timely basis or on favorable terms, if at all; (m) our ability to identify and consummate future investments in, or dispositions
of, healthcare assets and effectively manage our portfolio opportunities and our investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures
and minority interests, including our ability to dispose of such assets on favorable terms as a result of rights of first offer or rights
of first refusal in favor of third parties; (n) risks related to development, redevelopment and construction projects, including
costs associated with inflation, rising or elevated interest rates, labor conditions and supply chain pressures, and risks related to
increased construction and development in markets in which our properties are located, including adverse effect on our future occupancy
rates; (o) our ability to attract and retain talented employees; (p) the limitations and significant requirements imposed upon
our business as a result of our status as a REIT and the adverse consequences (including the possible loss of our status as a REIT) that
would result if we are not able to comply with such requirements; (q) the ownership limits contained in our certificate of incorporation
with respect to our capital stock in order to preserve our qualification as a REIT, which may delay, defer or prevent a change of control
of our company; (r) increases in our borrowing costs as a result of becoming more leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions
or other investment activity and rising or elevated interest rates; (s) our exposure to various operational risks, liabilities and
claims from our operating assets; (t) our dependency on a limited number of managers and tenants for a significant portion of our
revenues and operating income; (u) our exposure to particular risks due to our specific asset classes and operating markets, such
as adverse changes affecting our specific asset classes and the healthcare real estate sector, the competitiveness or financial viability
of hospitals on or near the campuses where our outpatient medical buildings are located, our relationships with universities, the level
of expense and uncertainty of our research tenants, and the limitation of our uses of some properties we own that are subject to ground
lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements; (v) our ability to maintain a positive reputation for quality and service with
our key stakeholders; (w) the availability, adequacy and pricing of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained
by our managers, tenants, borrowers or other counterparties; (x) the risk of exposure to unknown liabilities from our investments
in properties or businesses; (y) the occurrence of cybersecurity threats and incidents that could disrupt our or our managers’,
tenants’ or borrower’s operations, result in the loss of confidential or personal information or damage our business relationships
and reputation; (z) the failure to maintain effective internal controls, which could harm our business, results of operations and
financial condition; (aa) the impact of merger, acquisition and investment activity in the healthcare industry or otherwise affecting
our managers, tenants or borrowers; (bb) disruptions to the management and operations of our business and the uncertainties caused by
activist investors; (cc) the risk of catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change;

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes
that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen
with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical
cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Funds From Operations attributable to common
stockholders (“FFO”) and Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders (“Normalized FFO”) to be appropriate
supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the
presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public
and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure
for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated
operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which
can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can
help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance
of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to
compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent
basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and
litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it
allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
Nareit Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders
(“Nareit FFO”)
The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance
with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method
investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments
for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be
calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.
Normalized FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Normalized
FFO”)
The Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following
income and expense items, without duplication: (a) gains and losses on derivatives, net and changes in the fair value of financial
instruments; (b) the non-cash impact of income tax benefits or expenses; (c) gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, net
including the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties
or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (d) transaction, transition and restructuring costs;
(e) amortization of other intangibles; (f) the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan; (g) net
expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; (h) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation
allowances; (i) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (j) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other
normalizing items related to noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities; and (k) other items set forth in the Normalized
FFO reconciliation included herein.
Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable
to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit
FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance
with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined
in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to
fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical
operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common
stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.

Adjusted EBITDA
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment and valuation allowances),
excluding (a) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; (b) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (c) noncontrolling
interests’ share of adjusted EBITDA; (d) net gains or losses on real estate activity; (e) gains or losses on re-measurement
of equity interest upon acquisition; (f) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (g) gains or losses on derivatives, net
and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (h) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events;
and including (x) Ventas’ share of adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities and (y) the impact of other items set
forth in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
Further Adjusted EBITDA
Further Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for transactions
and events that were completed during the period, as if the transaction or event had been consummated at the beginning of the relevant
period and considers any other incremental items set forth in the Further Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation included herein.
The Company considers NOI and Cash NOI as important supplemental measures
because they allow investors, analysts and the Company’s management to assess its unlevered property-level operating results and
to compare its operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis.
NOI
The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other
income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses.
Cash NOI
The Company defines Cash NOI as NOI for its reportable business segments
(i.e., SHOP, OM&R and NNN), determined on a Constant Currency basis, excluding the impact of, without duplication (i) non-cash

Same-Store
The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated and
operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that the Company may
include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full,
period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in the Company’s judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation
of its segment performance.
Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped
properties in the Company’s SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full
period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained
occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties
in the Company’s OM&R and NNN reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work
has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Our SHOP and NNN that have undergone operator or business model transitions
will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold,
classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted
by significant disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a significant
disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for OM&R and NNN reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention
to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize
value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an
expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and NNN reportable business segments, those properties that
are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of
the prior comparison period.
Constant Currency
To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based
disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results
are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average
monthly exchange rate for the current period.
