| Business Combination Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 4 – ACQUISITIONS OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTYWe acquire and invest in senior housing, outpatient medical buildings, research centers and other healthcare properties primarily to achieve an expected yield on our investment, to grow and diversify our portfolio and revenue base, and to reduce our dependence on any single manager or tenant, geographic location, asset type, business model or revenue source. Each of our acquisitions disclosed below was accounted for as an asset acquisition.2025 AcquisitionsIn January 2025, we acquiredtwosenior housing communities reported within our SHOP segment for an aggregate purchase price of $70.0million.2024 AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired50senior housing communities reported within our SHOP segment andfivelong-term acute care facilities (“LTACs”) reported within our NNN segment for an aggregate purchase price of $1.9billion.2022 AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, for an aggregate purchase price of $453.2million, we acquired18outpatient medical buildings leased to affiliates of Ardent,onebehavioral health center,oneresearch center (all of which are reported within our OM&R segment) andtwosenior housing communities (which are reported within our SHOP segment). | c-1 |  |
| Business Combinations Policy | Accounting for Real Estate AcquisitionsWhen we acquire real estate, we first make reasonable judgments about whether the transaction involves an asset or a business. Our real estate acquisitions are generally accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. We record the cost of the assets acquired as tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their relative fair values as of the acquisition date.Our asset acquisitions may include one or more groups of real estate properties within which there are different types of tangible and intangible assets, typically consisting of land, buildings, site improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and lease intangibles.  When we acquire multiple real estate properties in a single transaction, we first assess the individual fair value of the real estate properties and then determine the individual fair value of the various types of tangible and intangible assets therein. The individual fair value of the real estate properties is estimated by applying a valuation methodology such as the direct capitalization method of the income approach, which includes estimate for a capitalization rate, annual gross income, vacancy, and expenses based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends as well as market and economic conditions.We estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis or replacement cost basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building, generally35years. We determine the fair value of other fixed assets, such as site improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets’ estimated remaining useful lives, generally15years for land improvements and20years for building improvements. We determine the value of land either by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. We generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost. However, for certain acquired properties that are part of a ground-up development, we determine fair value by using the same valuation approach as for all other properties and deducting the estimated cost to complete the development. During the remaining construction period, we capitalize project costs until the development has reached substantial completion. Construction in progress, including capitalized interest, is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.Intangibles primarily include the value of in-place leases and acquired lease contracts. We include all lease-related intangible assets and liabilities within Acquired lease intangibles and Accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.The fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles, if any, reflects: (i) the estimated value of any above or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and in-place lease rent; and (ii) the estimated value of in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the acquired space was vacant. We amortize any acquired lease-related intangibles to revenue or amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any assumed bargain renewal periods. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed upon expiration, we recognize all unamortized amounts of lease-related intangibles associated with that lease in operations over the shortened lease term.We estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets and liabilities, if any, by discounting the difference between the applicable property’s acquisition date fair value and an estimate of its future option price. We do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease, but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon sale.In connection with an acquisition, we may assume rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property. We generally assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement. We assess assumed operating leases, including ground leases, to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us given current market conditions on the acquisition date. To the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us relative to market conditions on the acquisition | c-1 |  |
| Cash And Cash Equivalents Policy Text Block | Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturity date of three months or less when purchased. These investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. | c-1 |  |

| Commitments And Contingencies Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 14 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFrom time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in connection with our business. In certain circumstances, regardless of whether we are a named party in a lawsuit, investigation, claim or other legal or regulatory proceeding, we may be contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our managers, tenants and borrowers or other third parties against, or may otherwise be responsible for, such actions, proceedings or claims. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations, including proceedings related to our senior housing operating portfolio, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license. These claims may not be fully insured and some may allege large damage amounts.It is the opinion of management, that the disposition of any such lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that are currently pending will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us. However, regardless of the merits of a particular action, investigation or claim, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources to defend and resolve these matters. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, and if management’s assessment of our liability with respect thereto is incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims could have a material adverse effect on us.From time to time, on behalf of ourselves or on behalf of our unconsolidated entities, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide guarantees, indemnities or other similar contingent obligations to third parties.  Such agreements may include, without limitation: (1) guarantees of all or a portion of the principal, interest and other amounts due under mortgage debt or other borrowings, (2) customary nonrecourse carve-out guarantees provided in connection with mortgage or other borrowings, (3) customary indemnifications of lenders for potential environmental liabilities, (4) completion guarantees provided to lenders, tenants, ground lessors or other third parties for the completion of development and redevelopment projects, (5) guarantees of payment of contingent tax obligations to tax credit investors who have purchased historic, new market and other tax credits from us or our unconsolidated entities, (6) guarantees of ground rent and other payment of ground rent and other obligations to ground lessors and (7) indemnities and other guarantees required in connection with the procurement of performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit.As of December 31, 2024 and 2023,notriggering events relating to our guarantees, indemnities or similar contingent obligations have occurred. Accordingly,nocontingent liability is recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. | c-1 |  |
| Compensation Related Costs Policy Text Block | Stock-Based CompensationWe recognize share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units (including time-based and performance-based awards), included in General, administrative and professional fees in our Consolidated Statements of Income generally on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the award. Forfeitures of share-based awards are recognized as they occur. | c-1 |  |
| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 3 – CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKWe use total revenues and total NOI in assessing our concentration of credit risk. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to total NOI.We are exposed to the credit risk of our tenants in our NNN and OM&R segments because those tenants are obligated to pay us rent and, in certain instances pay or reimburse us for some or all property-related expenses, including utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning, roads and grounds expense and other  expenses.. Because we engage independent managers to manage the properties in our SHOP segment in exchange for a management fee, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as the tenants in our NNN and OM&R segments.Our consolidated properties were located in48states, the District of Columbia,sevenCanadian provinces and the United Kingdom as of December 31, 2024, with properties inonestate (California) accounting for more than10% of our total revenues and NOI for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. | c-1 |  |

| Consolidation Subsidiaries Or Other Investments Consolidated Entities Policy | Redeemable OP Unitholder and Noncontrolling InterestsWe own a majority interest in NHP/PMB L.P. (“NHP/PMB”), a limited partnership formed in 2008 to acquire properties from entities affiliated with Pacific Medical Buildings LLC (“PMB”). Given our wholly-owned subsidiary is the general partner and the primary beneficiary of NHP/PMB, we consolidate NHP/PMB as a VIE. As of December 31, 2024, third-party investors owned3.8million Class A limited partnership units in NHP/PMB (“OP Units”), which represented33% of the total units then outstanding, and we owned7.7million Class B limited partnership units in NHP/PMB, representing the remaining67%. The OP Units may be redeemed at any time at the election of the holder for cash or, at our option,0.9051shares of our common stock per OP Unit, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. We are party by assumption to a registration rights agreement with the holders of the OP Units that requires us, subject to the terms and conditions and certain exceptions set forth therein, to file and maintain a registration statement relating to the issuance of shares of our common stock upon redemption of OP Units.The OP Units are classified outside of permanent equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets because they may be redeemed by third parties under circumstances that are outside of our control. We reflect the OP Units at the greater of cost or redemption value. We recognize changes in fair value through capital in excess of par value, net of cash distributions paid and | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Variable Interest Entity Policy | We identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. We perform this analysis on an ongoing basis.As it relates to investments in joint ventures, GAAP may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partner or partners. We assess limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions, and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership (“LP”) interests or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding LP interests. We also apply this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies (“LLCs”).We consolidate several VIEs that share the following common characteristics:•the VIE is in the legal form of an LP or LLC;•the VIE was designed to own and manage its underlying real estate investments;•we are the general partner or managing member of the VIE;•we own a majority of the voting interests in the VIE;•a minority of voting interests in the VIE are owned by external third parties, unrelated to us;•the minority owners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights in the VIE; and•we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE.We have separately identified certain special purpose entities that were established to allow investments in research projects by tax credit investors (“TCIs”). We have determined that these special purpose entities are VIEs, we are a holder of variable interests and we are the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, and therefore, we consolidate these special purpose entities. Our primary beneficiary determination is based upon several factors, including but not limited to the rights we have in directing the activities which most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance as well as certain guarantees which protect the TCIs from losses should a tax credit recapture event occur. | c-1 |  |
| Costs Associated With Exit Or Disposal Activities Or Restructurings Policy Text Block | Transaction, Transition and Restructuring CostsTransaction, transition and restructuring costs include expenses relating to mergers, acquisitions and investments; expenses relating to strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint ventures, partnerships, significant lease and management agreement transactions and similar arrangements; transition and integration expenses incurred by properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions; and expenses relating to organizational and other restructuring activities. | c-1 |  |

| Debt Policy Text Block | Exchangeable Senior NotesWe account for our exchangeable senior notes in accordance with ASC 470-20,Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (after the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”)).We evaluate the exchange features embedded in our exchangeable senior notes in accordance with ASC 815,Derivatives and Hedging. ASC 815 requires embedded derivatives to be separated from their host non-derivative contracts and accounted for as free-standing derivative financial instruments if, and only if, each of the following three criteria is met: (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Certain contracts that involve an entity’s own equity are explicitly exempted from the requirements of ASC 815. | c-1 |  |

We are required, pursuant to the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes, to settle the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes in cash and may elect to settle any remaining exchange obligation (i.e., the stock price in excess of the exchange obligation) in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. Under the if-converted method, we include the number of shares required to satisfy the exchange obligation, assuming all the Exchangeable Notes are exchanged. The average closing price of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 is used as the basis for determining the dilutive effect on earnings per share. The Exchangeable Notes were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as they were antidilutive.Our unsettled equity forward sales agreements do not impact basic earnings per share. We apply the treasury stock method to our unsettled equity forward sales agreements to determine their dilutive effect, if any. See “Note 16 – Permanent and Temporary Equity.” | c-1 |  |

The ownership percentages in the table reflect our interest in the entities. Joint venture members, including us in some instances, have equity participation rights based on the underlying performance of the investments, which could result in non pro rata distributions.(2)Includes investments in parking structures and other de minimis investments in unconsolidated real estate entities.We provide various services to our unconsolidated real estate entities in exchange for fees and reimbursements. Total management fees earned in connection with these services were $15.5million, $14.7million and $14.5million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Such amounts, along with any promote revenue, are included in Third-party capital management revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income.Investments in Unconsolidated Operating EntitiesWe own investments in unconsolidated operating entities such as Ardent and Atria, which are included within Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of December 31, 2024, we held a34% ownership interest in Atria, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appointtwomembers to the Atria Board of Directors.As of December 31, 2024, we held an approximately6.7% ownership interest in Ardent.Oneof our executive officers is currently a member of the Ardent Board of Directors. Going forward, we have the right (but not the obligation) to nominateonemember of the Ardent Board of Directors for so long as we beneficially own4% or more of the total voting power of the outstanding common stock of Ardent, pursuant to our nomination agreement with Ardent. Following Ardent’s initial public offering, which was consummated in July 2024, our equity stake in Ardent decreased from the issuance of primary shares from7.5% to approximately6.7%, which resulted in a gain of $8.7million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is included in Income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income.In May 2023, we sold approximately24% of our ownership interest in Ardent to a third-party investor for $50.1million in total proceeds. As a result of the sale, we recognized $33.5million of gain for the year ended December 31, 2023 in Income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income and our ownership interest in Ardent was reduced from9.8% to7.5%. | c-1 |  |
| Equity Method Investments Policy | Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesWe report investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. We adjust our investment in unconsolidated entities for additional contributions made, distributions received as well as our share of the investee’s earnings or losses, which is included in Income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income.We base the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities on the fair value of the assets at the time we acquired the joint venture interest. We estimate fair values for our equity method investments based on discounted cash flow models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums or discounts. The capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads we use in these models are based upon assumptions that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments.We generally amortize any difference between our cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level, if any, over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and include that amortization in our share of income or loss from unconsolidated entities. For earnings of equity method investments with pro rata distribution allocations, net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on their respective stated ownership percentages. In other instances, net income or loss may be allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on the hypothetical liquidation at book value method (the “HLBV method”). Under the HLBV method, net income or loss is allocated between the partners based on the difference between each partner’s claim on the net assets of the joint venture at the end and beginning of the period, after taking into account contributions and distributions. Each partner’s share of the net assets of the joint venture is calculated as the amount that the partner would receive if the joint venture were to liquidate all of its assets at net book value and distribute the resulting cash to creditors and partners in accordance with their respective priorities. Under the HLBV method, in any given period, we could record more or less income than the joint venture has generated, than actual cash distributions we receive or than the amount we may receive in the event of an actual liquidation. | c-1 |  |

Accordingly, the estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange.Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisIn the above table, stock warrants consist of the Brookdale Warrants and the Scion Warrants. The Brookdale Warrants represent an interest in a publicly-traded entity and their fair value is based on Level 2 inputs that are obtained from public sources such as equity spot price, dividend yield, volatility and risk-free rate.The Scion Warrants represent a financial interest in a private entity whose fair value is based on Level 3 inputs that reflect significant assumptions including underlying enterprise value, market volatility, duration, dividend rate and risk-free rate. Changes in one or more of these inputs could impact the fair value determination. During the year ended December 31, | c-1 |  |
| Fair Value Of Financial Instruments Policy | Fair Values of Financial InstrumentsFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and we determine fair value based on the assumptions that we expect market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).The fair value hierarchy is as follows:•Level 1 inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access.•Level 2 inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs for the asset or liability that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves.•Level 3 inputs - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which typically are based on our own assumptions, because there is little, if any, related market activity.If the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the entire fair value measurement falls is the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. If the volume and level of market activity for an asset or liability has decreased significantly relative to the normal market activity for such asset or liability (or similar assets or liabilities), then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value. In addition, if there is evidence that a transaction for an asset or liability is not orderly, little, if any, weight is placed on that transaction price as an indicator of fair value. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments whose fair value is determined on a recurring basis.•Cash and cash equivalents -The carrying amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.•Escrow deposits and restricted cash-The carrying amount of escrow deposits and restricted cash reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.•Loans receivable -We estimate the fair value of loans receivable using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, including underlying asset performance and credit quality. We discount future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same terms and length to maturity would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings.•Available for sale securities -We estimate the fair value of marketable debt securities using Level 2 inputs. We observe quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access. We | c-1 |  |

| Government Grant Income Policy Policy Text Block | Government AssistanceWe applied for and received grants under Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 of the Provider Relief Fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (“HHS”) on behalf of the assisted living communities in our senior living operations segment to partially mitigate losses attributable to COVID-19. These grants are intended to reimburse eligible providers for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. We will not be required to repay distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, provided that we attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including, not using grants received from the Provider Relief Fund to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse, reporting and record keeping requirements and cooperating with any government audits. See “Government Regulation—CARES Act and Similar Governmental Funding Programs” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.We, and our managers, tenants, borrowers and investments in unconsolidated entities also received grants under other government programs on behalf of our senior housing communities primarily to partially mitigate losses attributable to COVID-19.During 2024 and 2023, we didnotreceive any HHS grants. During 2022, we received $54.2million in HHS grants. These grants are recognized as a contra expense within Property-level operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which they were received. Any grants that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our SHOP segment that are attributable to COVID-19. Further, although we continue to monitor and evaluate the terms and conditions associated with these government grants, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all requirements related to the payments received, in which case some or all of the grants received may need to be repaid. | c-1 |  |
| Historic And New Market Tax Credits Policy Policy Text Block | Accounting for Historic and New Markets Tax CreditsFor certain of our research centers, we are party to contractual arrangements with TCIs that were established to enable the TCIs to receive benefits of historic tax credits (“HTCs”), new markets tax credits (“NMTCs”) or both. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we ownedzeroandoneproperty that had syndicated NMTCs to TCIs.In general, TCIs invest cash into special purpose entities that invest in entities that own the subject property and generate the tax credits. The TCIs receive substantially all of the tax credits and hold only a nominal interest in the economic risk and benefits of the special purpose entities.HTCs are delivered to the TCIs upon substantial completion of the project. NMTCs are allowed for up to39% of a qualified investment and are delivered to the TCIs after the investment has been funded and spent on a qualified business. HTCs are subject to recapture within five years of substantial completion. The amount of the recapture is equal to100% of the HTCs during the first year after the completion of the historic rehabilitation and is reduced by20% each year during the subsequent five-year period. NMTCs are subject to recapture until the end of the seventh year following the qualifying investment. We have provided the TCIs with certain guarantees which protect the TCIs from losses should a tax credit recapture event occur. The contractual arrangements with the TCIs include a put/call provision whereby we may be obligated or entitled to repurchase the interest of the TCIs in the special purpose entities at the end of the tax credit recapture period. We anticipate that either the TCIs will exercise their put rights or we will exercise our call rights prior to the applicable tax credit recapture periods.The portion of the TCI’s investment that is attributed to the put is recorded at fair value at inception in accounts payable and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and is accreted to the expected put price as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the recapture period. The remaining balance of the TCI’s investment is initially recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be relieved upon delivery of the tax credit to the TCI, as a reduction in the carrying value of the subject property, net of allocated expenses. Direct and incremental costs incurred in structuring the transaction are deferred and will be recognized as an increase in the cost basis of the subject property upon the recognition of the related tax credit as discussed above. | c-1 |  |

| Impairment Or Disposal Of Long Lived Assets Including Intangible Assets Policy Policy Text Block | Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible AssetsWe periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. In performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. We adjust the net book value of properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. We recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination.If impairment indicators arise with respect to intangible assets with finite useful lives, we evaluate impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, then we estimate the fair value of the asset and compare the estimated fair value to the intangible asset’s carrying value. We recognize any shortfall from carrying value as an impairment loss in the current period.We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment at least annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may exceed its fair value. If we determine that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated entity is other-than-temporary, and if such reduced fair value is below the carrying value, we record an impairment.We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. We first assess qualitative factors, such as current macroeconomic conditions, state of the equity and capital markets and our overall financial and operating performance, to determine the likelihood that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we proceed with estimating the fair value of the operating unit. A goodwill impairment, if any, will be recognized in the period it is determined and is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. | c-1 |  |
| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 13 – INCOME TAXESWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Code for every year beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. We have also elected for certain of our subsidiaries to be treated as TRS entities, which are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes. All entities other than the TRS entities are collectively referred to as the “REIT” within this note. Certain REIT entities are subject to foreign income tax.Although we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will enable us to qualify as a REIT, such qualification depends upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various distribution, stock ownership and other tests.Our tax treatment of distributions per common share was as follows:For the Years Ended December 31,202420232022Tax treatment of distributions:Ordinary income$—$—$—Qualified ordinary income—0.044680.04906199A qualified business income1.095801.494651.75094Long-term capital gain—0.09136—Non-dividend distribution0.704200.16931—Distribution reported for 1099-DIV purposes1.800001.800001.80000Add: Dividend declared in current year and taxable in following year0.450000.450000.45000Less: Dividend declared in prior year and taxable in current year(0.45000)(0.45000)(0.45000)Distribution declared per common share outstanding$1.80000$1.80000$1.80000We believe we have met the annual REIT distribution requirement by payment of at least90% of our estimated taxable income for 2024, 2023 and 2022.Our consolidated expense (benefit) for income taxes was as follows (dollars in thousands):For the Years Ended December 31,202420232022Current - Federal$324$534$(2,257)Current - State2,6302,5642,662Deferred - Federal(30,436)(6,135)338Deferred - State282301,310Current - Foreign2,6462,5873,217Deferred - Foreign(12,967)(9,319)(22,196)Total$(37,775)$(9,539)$(16,926)The 2024 income tax benefit is primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $28.6million change in valuation allowance due to purchase accounting activity. The 2023 income tax benefit is primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $3.2million benefit from internal restructurings of U.S. TRS entities. The 2022 income tax benefit is primarily due to losses at certain TRS entities and an income tax benefit of $11.9million from an internal restructuring of foreign TRS entities.Although the TRS entities and certain other foreign entities have paid minimal cash federal, state and foreign income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024, their income tax liabilities may increase in future years as we exhaust net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and as our operations grow. Such increases could be significant. | c-1 |  |
| Income Tax Policy Text Block | Federal Income TaxWe have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), for every year beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. Accordingly, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on net income that we distribute to our stockholders, provided that we continue to qualify as a REIT. However, with respect to certain of our subsidiaries that have elected to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS” or “TRS entities”), we record income tax expense or benefit, as those entities are subject to federal income tax similar to regular corporations. Certain foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign income tax, although they did not elect to be treated as TRSs.We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes us to change our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided | c-1 |  |

| Lessee Leases Policy Text Block | Accounting for Leased PropertyWe lease real property, primarily land and corporate office space, and equipment, primarily vehicles at our senior housing communities. At lease inception, we establish an operating lease asset and operating lease liability, calculated as the present value of future minimum lease payments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use a discount rate that approximates our incremental borrowing rate available at lease commencement to determine the present value. Our lease expense primarily consists of ground and corporate office leases. Ground lease expense is included in Interest expense and corporate office lease expense is included in General, administrative and professional fees in our Consolidated Statements of Income. | c-1 |  |

| Loans And Leases Receivable Real Estate Acquired Through Foreclosure Policy | Accounting for Foreclosed PropertiesThe Company may receive properties pursuant to a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or other legal action in full or partial settlement of loans receivable by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. We refer to such actions as a “foreclosure” and to such properties as “foreclosed properties.” We account for foreclosed properties received in settlement of loans receivable in accordance with ASC 310,Receivables. Foreclosed real estate received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan and any debt assumed upon foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure. If the amortized cost basis in the loan exceeds the fair value of the collateral received, the difference is recorded as an allowance on loans receivable and investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Conversely, if the fair value of the collateral received is higher than the amortized cost basis in the loan, the difference, less the fair value of any debt assumed, less the principal amount of the loan | c-1 |  |

The loan provides us with a right of first offer to purchase the asset on certain terms and conditions. The loan has a3-yearterm and bears interest at a variable rate based on one-month SOFR, subject to a floor of4.50%, plus a spread of5.75%, increasing to6.00% commencing October 1, 2025.2023 ActivityOn May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that secured the Company’s cash-pay non-recourse mezzanine loan to Santerre Health Investors (the “Santerre Mezzanine Loan”) by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. As a result, the Santerre Mezzanine Loan is no longer outstanding. The properties consisted of a diverse pool of outpatient medical buildings, senior housing communities, triple-net leased skilled nursing facilities and hospital assets in the United States, which, at the time, also secured a $1billion non-recourse senior mortgage loan issued under the CHC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2019-CHC (the “CHC Mortgage Loan”). For additional information regarding the CHC Mortgage Loan, see “Note 10 – Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt.”Upon taking ownership of the portfolio, we reversed the previously recorded (in 2022) $20.0million CECL allowance and recognized a Gain on foreclosure of real estate of $29.1million in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The gain is the fair value of the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, less the fair value of the CHC Mortgage Loan, less the principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023 (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of non-real estate assets and liabilities and transaction costs.

If we determine that a credit loss exists with respect to individual investments, we will recognize an allowance against the amortized cost basis of the investment with a corresponding charge to net income (in Allowance on loans receivable and investments) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Income from available for sale securities is recognized when earned and gains or losses on securities sold, which are based on the specific identification method, and reported in Income from loans and investments in our Consolidated Statements of Income. | c-1 |  |

| Nature Of Operations | NOTE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSVentas, Inc., (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and other similar terms) is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on delivering strong, sustainable shareholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. We hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom.  As of December 31, 2024, we owned or had investments in1,387properties consisting of1,356properties in our reportable business segments (“Segment Properties”) and31properties held by unconsolidated real estate entities in our non-segment operations. Our Company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders.  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate and manage our assets.We operate through three reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we refer to as “SHOP,” outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we refer to as “OM&R,” and triple-net leased properties, which we refer to as “NNN.” We also hold assets outside of our reportable business segments, which we refer to as non-segment assets and which consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional private capital management platform, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”).Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each operating segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments, based on net operating income (“NOI”) for each segment. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including “Note 2 – Accounting Policies” and “Note 18 – Segment Information”.The following table summarizes information for our portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):SegmentNOI(1)Percentage of Total NOISegment PropertiesSenior housing operating portfolio (SHOP)$866,38341.9%629Outpatient medical and research portfolio (OM&R)579,27128.0%426Triple-net leased properties (NNN)606,22529.3%301Non-segment(2)17,2040.8%n/a$2,069,083100%1,356______________________________(1)“NOI” is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses.

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | Recent Accounting StandardsIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09,Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures(“ASU 2023-09”), which requires public entities on an annual basis to (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275,The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors, which requires registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The new rules would be effective for annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2025. However, in April 2024, the SEC exercised its discretion to stay these rules pending the completion of judicial review of certain consolidated petitions with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in connection with these rules. We are evaluating the impact of this rule on our Consolidated Financial Statements.On November 4, 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses(DISE), which requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities (PBEs). ASU 2024-03 requires a footnote disclosure about specific expenses by requiring PBEs to disaggregate, in a tabular presentation, each relevant expense caption on the face of the income statement that includes certain natural expenses relevant to the Company, such as (1) employee compensation, (2) depreciation and (3) intangible asset amortization. The tabular disclosure would also include certain other expenses, when applicable. The ASU does not change the expense captions an entity presents on the face of the income statement; rather, it requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified categories in disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The requirements will be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. We are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. | c-1 |  |

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred fees to Atria of $62.9million, $63.4million and $61.5million, respectively, which are recorded within property-level operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred fees to Atria of $0.1million, $1.5million and $6.1million, respectively, primarily in connection with the transition of senior housing communities operated by Atria, which are recorded within Transaction, transition and restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income.ArdentAs of December 31, 2024, we held an approximately6.7% ownership interest in Ardent.Oneof our executive officers is currently a member of the Ardent Board of Directors.

Following Ardent’s initial public offering, which was consummated in July 2024, our equity stake in Ardent decreased from the issuance of primary shares from7.5% to approximately6.7%, which resulted in a gain of $8.7million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which is included in Income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income.In May 2023, we sold approximately24% of our ownership interest in Ardent to a third-party investor for $50.1million in total proceeds.

| Revenue From Contract With Customer Policy Text Block | Revenue RecognitionNNN and OM&RIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842,Leases(“ASC 842”), we recognize rental revenue for operating lease arrangements when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical leased asset. Certain of our triple-net leases and most of our outpatient medical buildings and research centers’ (collectively, “outpatient medical and research portfolio”) leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent. We recognize base rental revenues under these leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectability of substantially all rents is probable.  Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight-line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, this cumulative excess totaled $202.7million and $194.1million, respectively (excluding properties classified as held for sale).Certain of our leases provide for periodic increases in base rent only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met. We recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases as the related parameters or contingencies are met, rather than on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term.We assess the probability of collecting substantially all rents under our leases based on several factors, including, among other things, payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the historical operations and operating trends of the property, the historical payment pattern of the tenant, the type of property, the value of the underlying collateral, if any, expected future performance of the property and current economic conditions. If our evaluation of these factors indicates it is not probable that we will be able to collect substantially all rents under the lease, we record a charge to rental income. If we change our conclusions regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lease, we may recognize adjustments to rental income in the period we make such change in our conclusions. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 18 – SEGMENT INFORMATIONAs of December 31, 2024, we operated throughthreereportable business segments: SHOP, OM&R and NNN. In our SHOP segment, we own and invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators to operate those communities. In our OM&R segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. In our NNN segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), long-term acute care facilities (“LTACs”), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and other healthcare facilities, throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease these properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Information provided for “non-segment” includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional private capital management platform, income from loans and investments and corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of ourthreereportable business segments. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and accounts receivable. Non-segment assets also include our investments in unconsolidated entities, including investments in unconsolidated real estate entities through our third-party institutional private capital management platform, VIM, and investments in unconsolidated operating entities, such as Ardent and Atria. Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles. Non-segment assets also include other assets, such as our Brookdale and Kindred Warrants. Total assets by reportable business segment is not disclosed as the CODM does not review such information to evaluate business performance and allocate resources. The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see “Note 2 – Accounting Policies”).Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Our CODM evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments based on NOI for each segment. Our CODM uses NOI to assess the performance of each segment and to allocate resources (including employees and financial or capital resources) primarily during the quarterly or annual business review and annual budget and forecasting process. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses. We consider NOI useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis.
