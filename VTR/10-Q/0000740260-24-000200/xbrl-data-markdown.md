We are required, pursuant to the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes, to settle the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes in cash and may elect to settle any remaining exchange obligation (i.e., the stock price in excess of the exchange obligation) in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. Under the if-converted method, we include the number of shares required to satisfy the exchange obligation, assuming all the Exchangeable Notes are exchanged. The average closing price of our common stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 is used as the basis for determining the dilutive effect on earnings per share. The average price of our common stock for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was less than the initial exchange price of $54.81and, therefore, all associated shares were antidilutive. | c-1 |  |

| Equity Method Investments Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 7—INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIESWe report investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. We are not required to consolidate these entities because our joint venture partners have significant participating rights, nor are these entities considered VIEs, as they are controlled by equity holders with sufficient capital. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments in both real estate entities and operating entities as described further below.Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate EntitiesBelow is a summary of our investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, including through VIM, as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively (dollars in thousands):Ownership as of(1)Carrying Amount as ofJune 30, 2024December 31, 2023June 30, 2024December 31, 2023Investments in unconsolidated real estate entities:Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund20.1%20.1%$262,374$264,442Pension Fund Joint Venture25.0%25.0%19,12522,169Research & Innovation Development Joint Venture53.0%53.0%290,619275,829Ventas Investment Management platform572,118562,440Atrium Health & Wake Forest Joint Venture48.5%48.5%36,11235,137All other(2)34.0%-37.5%34.0%-37.5%614629Total investments in unconsolidated real estate entities$608,844$598,206______________________________(1)The entities in which we have an ownership interest may have less than a100% interest in the underlying real estate.

Such amounts, along with any promote revenue, are included in third party capital management revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income.Investments in Unconsolidated Operating EntitiesWe own investments in unconsolidated operating entities such as Ardent and Atria, which are included within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of June 30, 2024, we held a34% ownership interest in Atria, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appointtwomembers to the Atria Board of Directors.As of June 30, 2024, we held a7.5% ownership interest in Ardent, which entitled us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appointonemember to the Ardent Board of Directors.

| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 13—INCOME TAXESWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for every year beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. We have also elected for certain of our subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS” or “TRS entities”), which are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.  All entities other than the TRS entities are collectively referred to as the “REIT” within this note. Certain REIT entities are subject to foreign income tax.Although the TRS entities and certain other foreign entities have paid minimal federal, state and foreign income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2024, their income tax liabilities may increase in future periods as we exhaust net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and as our operations grow. Such increases could be significant.Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was an expense of $7.8million and a benefit of $9.8million, respectively. Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was an expense of $4.8million and a benefit of $12.6million, respectively. The income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 is primarily due to the enactment of Bill C-59 in Canada, which limits the amount of interest expense we can deduct with respect to our Canadian entities.  Bill C-59 is retrospectively applied to October 1, 2023 and the cumulative effect tax of such interest limitation was recognized in the current quarter.  The impact of the interest limitation was partially offset by reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our TRS entities and losses in certain of our TRS entities. The income tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities as well as an $8.0million benefit from internal restructurings of our U.S. TRS entities. | c-1 |  |

These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations, including proceedings related to our senior housing operating portfolio, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license. These claims may not be fully insured and some may allege large damage amounts.It is the opinion of management, that the disposition of any such lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that are currently pending will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us. However, regardless of the merits of a particular action, investigation or claim, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources to defend and resolve these matters. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, and if management’s assessment of our liability with respect thereto is incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims could have a material adverse effect on us.From time to time, on behalf of ourselves or on behalf of our unconsolidated entities, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide guarantees, indemnities or other similar contingent obligations to third parties.  Such agreements may include, without limitation: (1) guarantees of all or a portion of the principal, interest and other amounts due under mortgage debt or other borrowings, (2) customary nonrecourse carve-out guarantees provided in connection with mortgage or other borrowings, (3) customary indemnifications of lenders for potential environmental liabilities, (4) completion guarantees provided to lenders, tenants, ground lessors or other third parties for the completion of development and redevelopment projects, (5) guarantees of payment of contingent tax obligations to tax credit investors who have purchased historic, new market and other tax credits from us or our unconsolidated entities, (6) guarantees of ground rent and other payment of ground rent and other obligations to ground lessors and (7) indemnities and other guarantees required in connection with the procurement of performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit.As of June 30, 2024, it is the opinion of management that (i) our liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and (ii) the risk of us being required to make payments under these arrangements is remote, in each case, individually and in the aggregate. Accordingly,nocontingent liability is recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for any of these arrangements. | c-1 |  |

| Nature Of Operations | NOTE 1—DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSVentas, Inc., (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and other similar terms) an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on delivering strong, sustainable shareholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. We hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom. As of June 30, 2024, we owned or had investments in approximately1,350properties (including properties classified as held for sale and unconsolidated properties). Our company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999.  Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders.  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of highly technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate or manage our assets.We primarily invest in our portfolio of real estate assets through wholly-owned subsidiaries and other co-investment entities. We operate throughthreereportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as “SHOP,” outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we also refer to as “OM&R,” and triple-net leased properties. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. In addition, from time to time, we make secured and unsecured loans and other investments relating to real estate or operators. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each operating segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments, in significant part, based on net operating income (“NOI”) and related measures for each segment. See “Note 16 – Segment Information.” For a discussion of our definition of NOI and for a reconciliation of NOI to our net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”We also have investments in unconsolidated entities, including through our third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”).The following table summarizes information for our consolidated reportable business segments and non-segment assets for the six months ended June 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):SegmentTotal NOI(1)Percentage of Total NOINumber of Consolidated PropertiesSenior housing operating portfolio (SHOP)$417,72441.0%582Outpatient medical and research portfolio (OM&R)291,84228.7%428Triple-net leased properties302,05829.7%308Non-segment(2)6,6140.6%—$1,018,238100%1,318______________________________(1)“NOI” is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | Recent Accounting StandardsIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07,Segment Reporting—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures(“ASU 2023-07”), which requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments. Required disclosures include, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount for other segment items (which is the difference between segment revenue less segment expenses and less segment profit or loss) and a description of its composition, the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The standard also permits disclosure of more than one measure of segment profit. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 16—SEGMENT INFORMATIONAs of June 30, 2024, we operated throughthreereportable business segments: SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties. In our SHOP segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators to operate those communities. In our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. In our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), long-term acute care facilities (“LTACs”), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and other healthcare facilities throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Information provided for “non-segment” includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of ourthreereportable business segments. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities including VIM.Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on NOI and related measures for each segment. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. We consider NOI useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical consolidated operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general, administrative and professional fees, income tax expense and other non-property-specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual reportable business segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. There arenointersegment sales or transfers. | c-1 |  |
| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | NOTE 2—ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included.  Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.GAAP requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Substantially all of the assets of the VIEs are real estate investments and substantially all of the liabilities of the VIEs are mortgage loans. Assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of such VIEs. Liabilities of the consolidated VIEs represent claims against the specific assets of the VIEs.Unless otherwise required by an operating agreement, any mortgage loans of the consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to us.The table below summarizes the total assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands):As of June 30, 2024As of December 31, 2023Total AssetsTotal LiabilitiesTotal AssetsTotal LiabilitiesNHP/PMB L.P.$748,205$280,103$759,817$266,658Fonds Immobilier Groupe Maurice, S.E.C.1,894,8401,169,2111,971,4101,204,619Other identified VIEs1,602,668361,8541,597,957354,828Tax credit VIEs27,8794,40029,7464,024Recent Accounting StandardsIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07,Segment Reporting—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures(“ASU 2023-07”), which requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments.
