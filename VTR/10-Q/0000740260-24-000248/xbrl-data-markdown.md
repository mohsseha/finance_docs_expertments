| Asset Acquisition Text Block | NOTE 4—ACQUISITIONS OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTYWe acquire and invest in senior housing, outpatient medical buildings, research centers and other healthcare properties primarily to achieve an expected yield on our investment, to grow and diversify our portfolio and revenue base, and to reduce our dependence on any single tenant, operator or manager, geographic location, asset type, business model or revenue source. Each of our acquisitions disclosed below was accounted for as an asset acquisition.2024 AcquisitionsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired11senior housing communities reported within our SHOP segment andfivelong term acute care hospitals (“LTACs”) reported within our triple-net leased properties segment for an aggregate purchase price of $516.1million.In October 2024, we acquired25senior housing communities reported within our SHOP segment for $923.0million. | c-1 |  |
| Basis Of Accounting Policy Policy Text Block | The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”).

| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 3—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKWe use total revenues and total NOI in assessing our concentration of credit risk. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to total NOI.We are exposed to the credit risk of our tenants in our NNN and OM&R segments because those tenants are obligated to pay us rent and, in certain instances pay or reimburse us for some or all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Because we engage independent managers to manage the properties in our SHOP segment in exchange for a management fee, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as the tenants in our NNN and OM&R segments.The following table summarizes certain information about our credit risk concentration for our NNN and OM&R segments for the three months ended September 30, 2024:For the Three Months Ended September 30,20242023Revenues:(1)Brookdale(2)3.1%3.3%Ardent(3)2.82.9Kindred2.82.9All others22.925.2Net operating income (“NOI”):Brookdale(2)7.3%7.6%Ardent(3)6.76.8Kindred6.86.8All others37.541.9____________________________(1)Represents percentage of total revenues which include third party capital management revenues, income from loans and investments and interest and other income.(2)Results exclude9senior housing communities which are included in our SHOP segment.(3)Results exclude19outpatient medical buildings included in “All others.” | c-1 |  |

| Legal Matters And Contingencies Text Block | NOTE 12—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFrom time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in connection with our business. In certain circumstances, regardless of whether we are a named party in a lawsuit, investigation, claim or other legal or regulatory proceeding, we may be contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our tenants, operators, managers or other third parties against, or may otherwise be responsible for, such actions, proceedings or claims. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations, including proceedings related to our senior housing operating portfolio, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license. These claims may not be fully insured and some may allege large damage amounts.It is the opinion of management, that the disposition of any such lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that are currently pending will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us. However, regardless of the merits of a particular action, investigation or claim, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources to defend and resolve these matters. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, and if management’s assessment of our liability with respect thereto is incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims could have a material adverse effect on us.From time to time, on behalf of ourselves or on behalf of our unconsolidated entities, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide guarantees, indemnities or other similar contingent obligations to third parties.

| Nature Of Operations | NOTE 1—DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSVentas, Inc., (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and other similar terms) an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on delivering strong, sustainable shareholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. We hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2024, we owned or had investments in approximately1,350properties (including properties classified as held for sale and unconsolidated properties). Our company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999.  Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders.  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of highly technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate or manage our assets.We operate throughthreereportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as “SHOP,” outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we also refer to as “OM&R,” and triple-net leased properties, which we also refer to as “NNN.” Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund.Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments based on net operating income (“NOI”) for each segment. See “Note 16 – Segment Information.” For a discussion of our definition of NOI and for a reconciliation of NOI to our net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”The following table summarizes information for our consolidated reportable business segments and non-segment assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):SegmentTotal NOI(1)Percentage of Total NOINumber of Consolidated PropertiesSenior housing operating portfolio (SHOP)$631,70641.3%591Outpatient medical and research portfolio (OM&R)435,93828.5%426Triple-net leased properties (NNN)453,02829.6%302Non-segment(2)10,7160.7%—$1,531,388100%1,319______________________________(1)“NOI” is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 16—SEGMENT INFORMATIONAs of September 30, 2024, we operated throughthreereportable business segments: SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties. In our SHOP segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators to operate those communities. In our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. In our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), long term acute care hospitals (“LTACs”), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and other healthcare facilities throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Information provided for “non-segment” includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of ourthreereportable business segments. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”).Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments based on NOI for each segment. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. We consider NOI useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical consolidated operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general, administrative and professional fees, income tax expense and other non-property-specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual reportable business segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. There arenointersegment sales or transfers. | c-1 |  |
| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | NOTE 2—ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.GAAP requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Substantially all of the assets of the VIEs are real estate investments and substantially all of the liabilities of the VIEs are mortgage loans. Assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of such VIEs. Liabilities of the consolidated VIEs represent claims against the specific assets of the VIEs.Unless otherwise required by an operating agreement, any mortgage loans of the consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to us.The table below summarizes the total assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands):As of September 30, 2024As of December 31, 2023Total AssetsTotal LiabilitiesTotal AssetsTotal LiabilitiesNHP/PMB L.P.$750,258$289,867$759,817$266,658Fonds Immobilier Groupe Maurice, S.E.C.1,899,6041,177,8641,971,4101,204,619Other identified VIEs1,587,859380,0341,597,957354,828Tax credit VIEs(1)——29,7464,024____________________________(1)Balances as of September 30, 2024 reflect the completion of the tax credit structure unwinds.Recent Accounting StandardsIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07,Segment Reporting—Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures(“ASU 2023-07”), which requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments.

In connection with our entry into the 2024 ATM Program, we terminated our prior “at-the-market” equity offering program (together with the 2024 ATM Program, the “ATM Programs”) under the ATM Sales Agreement dated November 8, 2021 and amended February 20, 2024, pursuant to which we previously, from time to time, could sell up to $1.0billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock. The ATM Programs have allowed us to enter into forward sales agreements, discussed below. By utilizing a forward sales agreement, we can secure a share price on the sale of shares of our common stock at or shortly after the time the forward sales agreement becomes effective, while postponing the receipt of proceeds from the sale of shares until a future date.As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount available under our 2024 ATM Program for future sales of our common stock was $1.9billion.ATM Share IssuancesDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued5.9million shares of our common stock under our ATM Programs for gross proceeds of $362.6million, representing an average price of $61.22per share, of which4.5million shares and $282.0million of gross proceeds were issued and settled via forward sales agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued16.4million shares of our common stock under our ATM Programs for gross proceeds of $862.0million, representing an average price of $52.70per share, of which4.5million shares and $282.0million of gross proceeds were issued and settled via forward sales agreements.Forward Sales AgreementsForward sales agreements generally have a maturity of one to two years. At any time during the term of a forward sale agreement, we may settle that forward sales agreement by delivery of physical shares of our common stock to the forward purchaser or, at our election, subject to certain exceptions, we may settle in cash or by net share settlement. The forward sales price we expect to receive upon settlement of outstanding forward sales agreements will be the initial forward price, net of commissions, established on or shortly after the effective date of the relevant forward sales agreement, subject to adjustments for accrued interest, the forward purchasers’ stock borrowing costs in excess of a certain threshold specified in the forward sales | c-1 |  |
