| Basis Of Accounting Policy Policy Text Block | The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. | c-1 |  |

| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 3—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKAs of September 30, 2023, Atria, Sunrise, Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred managed or operated approximately23.6%,9.3%,7.6%,5.1% and0.8%, respectively, of our consolidated real estate investments based on gross book value (excluding properties classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023). Because Atria and Sunrise manage our properties in exchange for a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as triple-net tenants like Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred.Based on gross book value, approximately10.6% and55.0% of our consolidated real estate investments were senior housing communities included in the triple-net leased properties and SHOP reportable business segments, respectively (excluding properties classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023). Outpatient medical buildings, research centers, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and long-term acute care facilities (“LTACs”), health systems, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) and secured loans receivable and investments collectively comprised the remaining34.4%. Our consolidated properties were located in47states, the District of Columbia,sevenCanadian provinces and the United Kingdom as of September 30, 2023, with properties inonestate (California) accounting for more than10% of our total consolidated revenues and net operating income (“NOI,” which is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses) for each of the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. | c-1 |  |

We are required, pursuant to the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes, to settle the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes in cash and may elect to settle any remaining exchange obligation (i.e., the stock price in excess of the exchange obligation) in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. Under the if-converted method, we include the number of shares required to satisfy the exchange obligation, assuming all the Exchangeable Notes are exchanged. The average closing price of our common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is used as the basis for determining the dilutive effect on earnings per share. The average price of our common stock for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was less than the initial exchange price of $54.81and, therefore, all associated shares were antidilutive. | c-1 |  |

| Equity Method Investments Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 6—INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIESWe report investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. We are not required to consolidate these entities because our joint venture partners have significant participating rights, nor are these entities considered VIEs, as they are controlled by equity holders with sufficient capital. We invest in both real estate entities and operating entities which are described further below.Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate EntitiesThrough our Ventas Investment Management platform, which combines our extensive third-party capital ventures under a single platform, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in healthcare real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner.Below is a summary of our investments in unconsolidated real estate entities as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively (dollars in thousands):Ownership as of(1)Carrying Amount as ofSeptember 30, 2023December 31, 2022September 30, 2023December 31, 2022Investments in unconsolidated real estate entities:Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund20.6%21.0%$268,514$263,979Pension Fund Joint Venture23.6%22.9%27,05225,028Research & Innovation Development Joint Venture51.4%51.0%260,526284,962Ventas Investment Management platform556,092573,969Atrium Health & Wake Forest Joint Venture48.5%48.5%22,4435,403All other(2)34.0%-37.5%34.0%-37.5%637577Total investments in unconsolidated real estate entities$579,172$579,949______________________________(1)The entities in which we have an ownership interest may have less than a 100% interest in the underlying real estate. The ownership percentages in the table reflect our interest in the underlying real estate. Joint venture members, including us in some instances, have equity participation rights based on the underlying performance of the investments, which could result in non pro rata distributions.(2)Includes investments in parking structures and other de minimis investments in unconsolidated real estate entities. The balance as of September 30, 2023 includes investments in unconsolidated real estate entities that are recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.We provide various services to our unconsolidated real estate entities in exchange for fees and reimbursements. Total management fees earned in connection with these services were $3.6million and $4.2million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $10.9million and $11.5million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Such amounts are included in third party capital management revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income.Investments in Unconsolidated Operating EntitiesWe own investments in unconsolidated operating entities such as Ardent and Atria, which are included within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our34% ownership interest in Atria entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appointtwomembers to the Atria Board of Directors.As of September 30, 2023, we held a7.5% ownership interest in Ardent, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appointonemember to the Ardent Board of Directors. In May 2023, we sold approximately24% of our ownership interest in Ardent to a third-party investor for $50.1million in total proceeds. As a result of the sale, we recognized $33.5million of gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income and our ownership interest in Ardent was reduced from9.8% to7.5%. | c-1 |  |

| Fair Value Disclosures Text Block | NOTE 10—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSOverviewAccounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:•Level 1: Fair value calculated based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access.•Level 2: Fair value calculated using inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs for the asset or liability that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves.•Level 3: Fair value calculated using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which typically are based on our own assumptions, because there is little, if any, related market activity.The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange or transaction.Financial Instruments Measured at Fair ValueThe table below summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments either recorded or disclosed on a recurring basis (dollars in thousands):As of September 30, 2023As of December 31, 2022CarryingAmountFair ValueCarryingAmountFair ValueAssets:Cash and cash equivalents(1)$433,937$433,937$122,564$122,564Escrow deposits and restricted cash(1)57,80957,80948,18148,181Stock warrants(3)(5)34,90634,90623,62123,621Secured mortgage loans and other, net(3)(4)27,82327,853493,669493,627Non-mortgage loans receivable, net(3)(4)(5)24,58723,39624,33823,416Government-sponsored pooled loan investments, net(3)——43,40643,406Derivative instruments(3)(5)48,71348,71324,31624,316Liabilities:Senior notes payable and other debt, gross(3)(4)13,479,36212,503,78912,361,24411,493,824Derivative instruments(3)(6)4444145145Redeemable OP Units(2)153,351153,351162,663162,663______________________________(1)The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.(2)Level 1 within fair value hierarchy.(3)Level 2 within fair value hierarchy.(4)Level 3 within fair value hierarchy.(5)Included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.(6)Included in accounts payable and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Other Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisReal estate recorded as held for sale and any associated real estate impairment recorded due to the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to hold the asset (see “Note 4 – Dispositions And Impairments”) are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. We estimate the fair value of assets held for sale and any associated impairment charges based primarily on current sales price expectations, which reside within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. | c-1 |  |

| Government Grant Income Policy Policy Text Block | U.S. Department of Health & Human Services GrantsWe applied for grants under the Provider Relief Fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (“HHS”) on behalf of the assisted living communities in our SHOP reportable business segment to partially mitigate losses attributable to COVID-19. These grants are intended to reimburse eligible providers for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Recipients are not required to repay distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including not using grants received from the Provider Relief Fund to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse, complying with reporting and record keeping requirements and cooperating with any government audits. | c-1 |  |
| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 12—INCOME TAXESWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for every year beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. We have also elected for certain of our subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS” or “TRS entities”), which are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.  All entities other than the TRS entities are collectively referred to as the “REIT” within this note. Certain REIT entities are subject to foreign income tax.Although the TRS entities and certain other foreign entities have paid minimal federal, state and foreign income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, their income tax liabilities may increase in future periods as we exhaust net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and as our senior living and other operations grow. Such increases could be significant.Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was a benefit of $1.7million and a benefit of $6.0million, respectively. Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was a benefit of $14.2million and a benefit of $14.3million, respectively. The income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $8.0million benefit from internal restructurings of U.S. TRS entities. The income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $2.0million benefit from an internal restructuring of a U.S. TRS.Each TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities with respect to our TRS entities totaled $26.1million and $35.6million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and related primarily to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of fixed and intangible assets, net of loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets with respect to our TRS entities totaled $7.2million and $10.5million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and related primarily to loss carryforwards.Generally, we are subject to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subsequent years and are subject to audit by state taxing authorities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent years. We are subject to audit generally under the statutes of limitation by the Canada Revenue Agency and provincial authorities with respect to the Canadian entities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent years.

| Legal Matters And Contingencies Text Block | NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFrom time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in connection with our business. In certain circumstances, regardless of whether we are a named party in a lawsuit, investigation, claim or other legal or regulatory proceeding, we may be contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our tenants, operators, managers or other third parties against, or may otherwise be responsible for, such actions, proceedings or claims. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings, including proceedings related to our senior housing operating portfolio, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license. These claims may not be fully insured and some may allege large damage amounts.It is the opinion of management, that the disposition of any such lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that are currently pending will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us. However, regardless of the merits of a particular action, investigation or claim, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources to defend and resolve these matters. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, and if management’s assessment of our liability with respect thereto is incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims could have a material adverse effect on us. | c-1 |  |
| Loans And Leases Receivable Real Estate Acquired Through Foreclosure Policy | Accounting for Foreclosed PropertiesThe Company may receive properties pursuant to a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or other legal action in full or partial settlement of loans receivable by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. We refer to such actions as a “foreclosure” and to such properties as “foreclosed properties”. We account for foreclosed properties received in settlement of loans receivable in accordance with ASC 310,Receivables. Foreclosed real estate received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan and any debt assumed upon foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure. If the amortized cost basis in the loan exceeds the fair value of the collateral received, the difference is recorded as an allowance on loans receivable and investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Conversely, if the fair value of the collateral received is higher than the amortized cost basis in the loan, the difference, less the fair value of any debt assumed, less the principal amount of the loan receivable (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of working capital assumed and transaction costs, is recorded as a gain on foreclosure of real estate in the Consolidated Statements of Income. | c-1 |  |
| Loans Receivable And Investments Text Block | NOTE 5—LOANS RECEIVABLE AND INVESTMENTSAs of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had $52.4million and $561.4million, respectively, of loans receivable and investments, net of allowance, relating to senior housing and healthcare operators or properties.The following is a summary of our loans receivable and investments, net, including amortized cost, fair value and unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments (dollars in thousands):Amortized CostAllowanceCarrying AmountFair ValueAs of September 30, 2023:Secured/mortgage loans and other, net(1)$27,823$—$27,823$27,853Non-mortgage loans receivable, net(2)29,012(4,425)24,58723,396Total loans receivable and investments, net$56,835$(4,425)$52,410$51,249As of December 31, 2022:Secured/mortgage loans and other, net(3)$513,669$(20,000)$493,669$493,627Government-sponsored pooled loan investments, net(4)43,406—43,40643,406Total investments reported as secured loans receivable and investments, net557,075(20,000)537,075537,033Non-mortgage loans receivable, net(2)28,959(4,621)24,33823,416Total loans receivable and investments, net$586,034$(24,621)$561,413$560,449______________________________(1)Investments have contractual maturities in 2024 and 2027.(2)Included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.(3)Includes the Company’s cash-pay non-recourse mezzanine loan to Santerre Health Investors (the “Santerre Mezzanine Loan”), which was no longer outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Other included investments have contractual maturities in 2024 and 2027.(4)Repaid at par in February 2023.On May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. As a result, the Santerre Mezzanine Loan is no longer outstanding. The properties consisted of a diverse pool of outpatient medical buildings, senior housing operating portfolio communities, triple-net leased skilled nursing facilities and hospital assets in the United States, which, at the time, also secured a $1billion non-recourse senior mortgage loan issued under the CHC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2019-CHC (the “CHC Mortgage Loan”). For additional information regarding the CHC Mortgage Loan, see “Note 9 – Senior Notes Payable And Other Debt.”As of December 31, 2022, we recognized a $20.0million allowance on the Santerre Mezzanine Loan in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for the Santerre Mezzanine Loan was calculated using the “current expected credit loss”, or “CECL”, model, which considers relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate expected losses as of the most recent balance sheet date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reversed the $20.0million allowance and recognized a gain on foreclosure of real estate of $29.1million in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The gain is the fair value of the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, less the fair value of the CHC Mortgage Loan, less the principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023 (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of non-real estate assets and liabilities and transaction costs.

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 15—SEGMENT INFORMATIONAs of September 30, 2023, we operated throughthreereportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, SHOP and outpatient medical and research portfolio. In our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, we invest in and own senior housing and healthcare properties throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. In our SHOP reportable business segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators, such as Atria and Sunrise, to manage those communities. In our outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. Information provided for “non-segment” includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of ourthreereportable business segments. Assets included in “non-segment” consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments, and miscellaneous accounts receivable.Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on NOI and related measures for each segment. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. We consider NOI useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical consolidated operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | NOTE 2—ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.GAAP requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Substantially all of the assets of the VIEs are real estate investments, and substantially all of the liabilities of the VIEs are mortgage loans. Assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of such VIEs. Liabilities of the consolidated VIEs represent claims against the specific assets of the VIEs.The table below summarizes the total assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands):As of September 30, 2023As of December 31, 2022Total AssetsTotal LiabilitiesTotal AssetsTotal LiabilitiesNHP/PMB L.P.$755,811$260,651$741,890$252,518Fonds Immobilier Groupe Maurice, S.E.C.1,952,4531,177,7331,957,0751,170,928Other identified VIEs1,719,853366,9031,699,949333,185Tax credit VIEs118,99414,158128,24016,767U.S. Department of Health & Human Services GrantsWe applied for grants under the Provider Relief Fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (“HHS”) on behalf of the assisted living communities in our SHOP reportable business segment to partially mitigate losses attributable to COVID-19.
