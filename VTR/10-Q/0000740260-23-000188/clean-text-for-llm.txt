NOTE 1—DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Ventas, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and other similar terms), an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) operating at the intersection of healthcare and real estate. We hold a highly diversified portfolio of senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, which we generally refer to collectively as “healthcare real estate,” located throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2023, we owned or had investments in approximately
1,400
properties (including properties classified as held for sale). Our company was originally founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.
We primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets through wholly-owned subsidiaries and other co-investment entities. We operate through
three
reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as “SHOP” and which was formerly known as senior living operations, and outpatient medical and research portfolio, which was formerly known as office operations. See “Note 2 – Accounting Policies” and “Note 15 – Segment Information.” Our senior housing communities are either subject to triple-net leases, in which case they are included in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, or operated by third-party managers, in which case they are included in our SHOP reportable business segment.
As of September 30, 2023, we leased a total of
335
properties (excluding properties within our outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segment) to various healthcare operating companies under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Our
three
largest tenants, Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Brookdale Senior Living”), Ardent Health Partners, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Ardent”) and Kindred Healthcare, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Kindred”) leased from us
121
properties,
30
properties (including
19
outpatient medical buildings) and
29
properties, respectively, as of September 30, 2023.
As of September 30, 2023, pursuant to long-term management agreements, we engaged operators, such as Atria Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, including Holiday Retirement (“Holiday”), “Atria”) and Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Sunrise”), to manage
594
senior housing communities.
As of September 30, 2023, we owned or had investments in a total of
461
properties in our outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segment. These properties generally consist of outpatient medical buildings that are predominantly located on or contiguous to a health system campus and research properties that are affiliated with and often located on or contiguous to a university or academic medical campus. Through our Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc. subsidiary and our ownership interest in PMB Real Estate Services LLC, we also provide outpatient medical building management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States.
In addition, from time to time, we make secured and unsecured loans and other investments relating to healthcare real estate or operators.
We have a third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”), which includes our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in healthcare real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 2—ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.
GAAP requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Substantially all of the assets of the VIEs are real estate investments, and substantially all of the liabilities of the VIEs are mortgage loans. Assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of such VIEs. Liabilities of the consolidated VIEs represent claims against the specific assets of the VIEs.
The table below summarizes the total assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands):

U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Grants
We applied for grants under the Provider Relief Fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (“HHS”) on behalf of the assisted living communities in our SHOP reportable business segment to partially mitigate losses attributable to COVID-19. These grants are intended to reimburse eligible providers for expenses incurred to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. Recipients are not required to repay distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including not using grants received from the Provider Relief Fund to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse, complying with reporting and record keeping requirements and cooperating with any government audits.

VENTAS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not receive any HHS grants. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we received $
20.2
million and $
54.2
million, respectively, in HHS grants in connection with our applications and recognized these grants within property-level operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which they were received.
Accounting for Foreclosed Properties
The Company may receive properties pursuant to a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or other legal action in full or partial settlement of loans receivable by taking legal title or physical possession of the properties. We refer to such actions as a “foreclosure” and to such properties as “foreclosed properties”. We account for foreclosed properties received in settlement of loans receivable in accordance with ASC 310,
Receivables
. Foreclosed real estate received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan and any debt assumed upon foreclosure is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure. If the amortized cost basis in the loan exceeds the fair value of the collateral received, the difference is recorded as an allowance on loans receivable and investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Conversely, if the fair value of the collateral received is higher than the amortized cost basis in the loan, the difference, less the fair value of any debt assumed, less the principal amount of the loan receivable (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of working capital assumed and transaction costs, is recorded as a gain on foreclosure of real estate in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Exchangeable Senior Notes
We account for our exchangeable senior notes in accordance with ASC 470-20,
Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (after the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (
“
ASU
”
) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (
“
ASU 2020-06
”
)).
We evaluate the exchange features embedded in our exchangeable senior notes in accordance with ASC 815,
Derivatives and Hedging
. ASC 815 requires embedded derivatives to be separated from their host nonderivative contracts and accounted for as free-standing derivative financial instruments if, and only if, each of the following three criteria is met: (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Certain contracts that involve an entity’s own equity are explicitly exempted from the requirements of ASC 815.
NOTE 3—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
As of September 30, 2023, Atria, Sunrise, Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred managed or operated approximately
23.6
%,
9.3
%,
7.6
%,
5.1
% and
0.8
%, respectively, of our consolidated real estate investments based on gross book value (excluding properties classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023). Because Atria and Sunrise manage our properties in exchange for a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as triple-net tenants like Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred.
Based on gross book value, approximately
10.6
% and
55.0
% of our consolidated real estate investments were senior housing communities included in the triple-net leased properties and SHOP reportable business segments, respectively (excluding properties classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023). Outpatient medical buildings, research centers, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and long-term acute care facilities (“LTACs”), health systems, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) and secured loans receivable and investments collectively comprised the remaining
34.4
%. Our consolidated properties were located in
47
states, the District of Columbia,
seven
Canadian provinces and the United Kingdom as of September 30, 2023, with properties in
one
state (California) accounting for more than
10
% of our total consolidated revenues and net operating income (“NOI,” which is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses) for each of the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.

Triple-Net Leased Properties
The properties we triple-net leased to Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred accounted for a significant portion of total revenues and total NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

Each of our leases with Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred is a triple-net lease that obligates the tenant to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, and to comply with the terms of the mortgage financing documents, if any, affecting the properties. In addition, each of our Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred leases is guaranteed by a corporate parent.
Kindred Lease
As of September 30, 2023, we leased
29
properties to Kindred pursuant to a single, triple-net master lease agreement (together with certain other agreements related to such master lease, collectively, the “Kindred Lease”). As of September 30, 2023, the Kindred Lease represented approximately
6.8
% of the Company’s Total NOI.
Pursuant to the Kindred Lease, the
29
properties are divided into two groups. The first group is composed of
6
properties (“Group 1”) and the second group is composed of
23
properties (“Group 2”). The existing term of the Kindred Lease expires on April 30, 2028 for Group 1 and April 30, 2025 for Group 2. Kindred has the option to renew the Kindred Lease for the Group 1 properties for two 5-year extensions at the greater of escalated rent and fair market rent by providing written notice no later than one year prior to the applicable expiration date. Kindred currently has the option to renew the Kindred Lease for the Group 2 properties for one 5-year extension by providing written notice to us before May 1, 2024. The Kindred Lease is guaranteed by a parent company.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to elevated volumes and financial performance at the properties. As the pandemic receded, the financial performance has declined, largely driven by significantly elevated labor expense, including contract labor, and lower volumes.  While we believe that Kindred has taken and is taking targeted actions to attempt to improve the performance of the properties, there can be no assurance that Kindred will be able to do so. See also “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—If we need to replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations”, “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—A significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of tenants and managers, including Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent, Kindred, Atria and Sunrise” and “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—We face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

Senior Housing Operating Portfolio
As of September 30, 2023, Atria and Sunrise, collectively, provided comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to
313
of our
583
consolidated senior housing communities, for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to long-term management agreements.
As of September 30, 2023, Atria and its subsidiaries, including Holiday, managed a pool of
221
senior housing communities for Ventas. Ventas has the right to terminate the management contract for
70
of the communities on short notice.

Our Sunrise Management Agreements have initial terms expiring between 2035 and 2040. Ventas has the ability to terminate some or all of the Sunrise Management Agreements under certain circumstances.
We rely on our managers’ personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior housing operating portfolio efficiently and effectively. We also rely on our managers to set appropriate resident fees, provide accurate property-level financial results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.

Includes the Company’s cash-pay non-recourse mezzanine loan to Santerre Health Investors (the “Santerre Mezzanine Loan”), which was no longer outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Other included investments have contractual maturities in 2024 and 2027.
(4)
Repaid at par in February 2023.
On May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. As a result, the Santerre Mezzanine Loan is no longer outstanding. The properties consisted of a diverse pool of outpatient medical buildings, senior housing operating portfolio communities, triple-net leased skilled nursing facilities and hospital assets in the United States, which, at the time, also secured a $
1
billion non-recourse senior mortgage loan issued under the CHC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2019-CHC (the “CHC Mortgage Loan”). For additional information regarding the CHC Mortgage Loan, see “Note 9 – Senior Notes Payable And Other Debt.”
As of December 31, 2022, we recognized a $
20.0
million allowance on the Santerre Mezzanine Loan in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for the Santerre Mezzanine Loan was calculated using the “current expected credit loss”, or “CECL”, model, which considers relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate expected losses as of the most recent balance sheet date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reversed the $
20.0
million allowance and recognized a gain on foreclosure of real estate of $
29.1
million in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The gain is the fair value of the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, less the fair value of the CHC Mortgage Loan, less the principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023 (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of non-real estate assets and liabilities and transaction costs. For additional information, see “Note 10 – Fair Value Measurements”.

NOTE 6—INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES
We report investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. We are not required to consolidate these entities because our joint venture partners have significant participating rights, nor are these entities considered VIEs, as they are controlled by equity holders with sufficient capital. We invest in both real estate entities and operating entities which are described further below.
Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities
Through our Ventas Investment Management platform, which combines our extensive third-party capital ventures under a single platform, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in healthcare real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner.

The entities in which we have an ownership interest may have less than a 100% interest in the underlying real estate. The ownership percentages in the table reflect our interest in the underlying real estate. Joint venture members, including us in some instances, have equity participation rights based on the underlying performance of the investments, which could result in non pro rata distributions.

Includes investments in parking structures and other de minimis investments in unconsolidated real estate entities. The balance as of September 30, 2023 includes investments in unconsolidated real estate entities that are recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We provide various services to our unconsolidated real estate entities in exchange for fees and reimbursements. Total management fees earned in connection with these services were $

Investments in Unconsolidated Operating Entities
We own investments in unconsolidated operating entities such as Ardent and Atria, which are included within other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our
34
% ownership interest in Atria entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appoint
two
members to the Atria Board of Directors.
As of September 30, 2023, we held a
7.5

one
member to the Ardent Board of Directors. In May 2023, we sold approximately
24
% of our ownership interest in Ardent to a third-party investor for $
50.1
million in total proceeds. As a result of the sale, we recognized $
33.5
million of gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income and our ownership interest in Ardent was reduced from
9.8

Exchangeable Senior Notes
In June 2023, Ventas Realty issued $
862.5
million aggregate principal amount of its
3.75
% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”) in a private placement. The Exchangeable Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Ventas Realty and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Ventas. The Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a rate of
3.75
% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2023. The Exchangeable Notes mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. The net proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes were primarily used to repay the CHC Mortgage Loan. As of September 30, 2023, we had $
862.5
million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes outstanding.

VENTAS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
The Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of
18.2460
shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $
54.81
per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment, including in the event of the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $
0.45
per share, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes, Ventas Realty will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Ventas Realty’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes being exchanged. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2026, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods described in the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes. On or after March 1, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods.
We have evaluated and concluded that the exchange options embedded in our exchangeable senior notes are eligible for the entity’s own equity scope exception from ASC 815 and therefore, do not need to be bifurcated. Accordingly, we record our exchangeable senior notes as liabilities (included in senior notes payable and other debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets).
Senior Notes
In April 2023, our
100
% owned subsidiary, Ventas Canada Finance Limited (“Ventas Canada”), issued and sold C$
600.0
million aggregate principal amount of
5.398
% Senior Notes due 2028 in a private placement at par. Pursuant to cash tender offers, we used the proceeds to repurchase C$
613.7
million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes due in 2024 for an aggregate purchase price of C$
600.0
million plus accrued and unpaid interest as disclosed below:
•
In April 2023, we repurchased C$
527.0
million principal amount of our
2.80
% Senior Notes, Series E due April 2024 at
97.6
% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date.
•
In April 2023, we repurchased C$
86.7
million principal amount of our
4.125

As a result of the tender offers, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $
8.3
million in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Mortgages
In March 2023, we entered into a C$
271.8
million floating rate mortgage loan maturing in 2028 with an interest rate of CDOR +
0.88
%. The mortgage is secured by
14
SHOP communities in Canada.
On May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that supported the Santerre Mezzanine Loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. The properties consisted of a diverse pool of
153
assets, which, at the time, also secured the CHC Mortgage Loan. At the time of the equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, there was $
1
billion outstanding under the CHC Mortgage Loan and it accrued interest at a weighted average rate of LIBOR +
1.84
% and had matured on June 9, 2023. The CHC Mortgage Loan was recorded at fair value, which approximates par, on May 1, 2023.
On June 8, 2023, we voluntary prepaid, without penalty, $
656.6
million of the CHC Mortgage Loan. In connection with the prepayment,
83
properties were released from the collateral securing the CHC Mortgage Loan.
On June 9, 2023, we extended the maturity date of the CHC Mortgage Loan to June 9, 2024 and amended the CHC Mortgage Loan to replace its LIBOR-based rates with SOFR-based rates.
In August 2023, we repaid the remaining balance of the CHC Mortgage Loan of $
360.2
million at which time the CHC Mortgage Loan was no longer outstanding.

Derivatives and Hedging
In the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our operating results. We follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks.
We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes, and we have a policy of entering into contracts only with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When considered together with the underlying exposure that the derivative is designed to hedge, we do not expect that the use of derivatives in this manner would have any material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations.
As of September 30, 2023, our variable rate debt obligations of $
1.1
billion reflect, in part, the effect of $
143.7
million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities in March 2027, that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt.
As of September 30, 2023, our fixed rate debt obligations of $

2023 Activity
In the first quarter of 2023, we hedged an incremental $
200.0
million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt through the execution in March 2023 of
two-year
$
400.0
million notional swaps on our unsecured term loan due in June 2027, replacing a $
200.0
million notional swap that matured in January 2023. The swap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
In March 2023, in connection with our new C$
271.8
million mortgage loan, we entered into an interest rate swap totaling a notional amount of C$
271.8
million with a maturity of March 14, 2028 that effectively converts CDOR-based floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
In March and April 2023, we entered into a total of $
250.0
million aggregate forward starting swaps with a
ten-year
weighted average rate of
3.37
%. In July 2023, we terminated the above-mentioned forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of the $

NOTE 10—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Overview
Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:
•
Level 1: Fair value calculated based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access.
•
Level 2: Fair value calculated using inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs for the asset or liability that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves.
•
Level 3: Fair value calculated using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which typically are based on our own assumptions, because there is little, if any, related market activity.
The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange or transaction.
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value

Other Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Real estate recorded as held for sale and any associated real estate impairment recorded due to the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to hold the asset (see “Note 4 – Dispositions And Impairments”) are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. We estimate the fair value of assets held for sale and any associated impairment charges based primarily on current sales price expectations, which reside within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
20
VENTAS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Real estate impairment charges recorded due to our evaluation of recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable are based on company-specific inputs and our assumptions about the marketability of the properties as observable inputs are not available. As such, we have determined that these fair value measurements generally reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair value of real estate deemed to not be recoverable using the income approach and unobservable data such as net operating income and estimated capitalization and discount rates, and giving consideration to local and national industry market data including comparable sales.
The fair value of the collateral received in connection with the equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023 was determined using fair value determinations within Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the non-real estate assets and liabilities was based on their cost, given the short term nature of those balances and because cost was the best information available, which reside within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the CHC Mortgage Loan, which approximates par, was based on the absence of recent underlying trading activity, consideration of the near-term maturity date and adjustments for the credit-worthiness of the borrower, which reside within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the real estate properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan of $
1.566
billion (net of $
31.8
million of capital expenditures) on May 1, 2023 was determined using unobservable inputs primarily within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For SHOP and outpatient medical properties, fair value was based on either an income or market approach that took into account unobservable inputs such as direct capitalization rates, estimated NOI, market rents, costs per unit, replacement cost and estimates of future cash flows, which are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. For the majority of the SHOP properties, fair value was based on an income approach with significant unobservable inputs that included an average direct capitalization rate of
6.8
% on estimated expected stabilized NOI, adjusted based on cost per unit in certain cases. For the majority of the outpatient medical properties, fair value was based on an income approach with significant unobservable inputs that included an average direct capitalization rate of
6.7
% on estimated expected stabilized NOI, adjusted based on cost per square foot in certain cases. For triple-net leased properties, fair value was primarily based on an average estimated per bed value by property by state of $
88,000
, which was determined based on an assessment of recent transactions adjusted for property, operator and other characteristics such as contractual rent, tenant payment history, underlying operating trends, reimbursement rates and other market data.
NOTE 11—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
From time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in connection with our business. In certain circumstances, regardless of whether we are a named party in a lawsuit, investigation, claim or other legal or regulatory proceeding, we may be contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our tenants, operators, managers or other third parties against, or may otherwise be responsible for, such actions, proceedings or claims. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings, including proceedings related to our senior housing operating portfolio, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license. These claims may not be fully insured and some may allege large damage amounts.
It is the opinion of management, that the disposition of any such lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that are currently pending will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us. However, regardless of the merits of a particular action, investigation or claim, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources to defend and resolve these matters. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, and if management’s assessment of our liability with respect thereto is incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims could have a material adverse effect on us.

NOTE 12—INCOME TAXES
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for every year beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. We have also elected for certain of our subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS” or “TRS entities”), which are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.  All entities other than the TRS entities are collectively referred to as the “REIT” within this note. Certain REIT entities are subject to foreign income tax.
Although the TRS entities and certain other foreign entities have paid minimal federal, state and foreign income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, their income tax liabilities may increase in future periods as we exhaust net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and as our senior living and other operations grow. Such increases could be significant.
Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was a benefit of $
1.7
million and a benefit of $
6.0
million, respectively. Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was a benefit of $
14.2
million and a benefit of $
14.3
million, respectively. The income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $
8.0
million benefit from internal restructurings of U.S. TRS entities. The income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $
2.0
million benefit from an internal restructuring of a U.S. TRS.
Each TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities with respect to our TRS entities totaled $
26.1
million and $
35.6
million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and related primarily to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of fixed and intangible assets, net of loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets with respect to our TRS entities totaled $
7.2
million and $
10.5
million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and related primarily to loss carryforwards.
Generally, we are subject to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subsequent years and are subject to audit by state taxing authorities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent years. We are subject to audit generally under the statutes of limitation by the Canada Revenue Agency and provincial authorities with respect to the Canadian entities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent years.  We are subject to audit in the United Kingdom generally for periods ended in and subsequent to 2021.
NOTE 13—STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Capital Stock
We participate in an “at-the-market” equity offering program (“ATM program”), pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to $

Potential common shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share when a loss from continuing operations exists as the effect would be an antidilutive per share amount.
The dilutive effect of our Exchangeable Notes is calculated using the if-converted method in accordance with ASU 2020-06. We are required, pursuant to the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes, to settle the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes in cash and may elect to settle any remaining exchange obligation (i.e., the stock price in excess of the exchange obligation) in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. Under the if-converted method, we include the number of shares required to satisfy the exchange obligation, assuming all the Exchangeable Notes are exchanged. The average closing price of our common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is used as the basis for determining the dilutive effect on earnings per share. The average price of our common stock for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was less than the initial exchange price of $
54.81
and, therefore, all associated shares were antidilutive.

NOTE 15—SEGMENT INFORMATION
As of September 30, 2023, we operated through
three
reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, SHOP and outpatient medical and research portfolio. In our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, we invest in and own senior housing and healthcare properties throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. In our SHOP reportable business segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators, such as Atria and Sunrise, to manage those communities. In our outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. Information provided for “non-segment” includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our
three
reportable business segments. Assets included in “non-segment” consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments, and miscellaneous accounts receivable.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on NOI and related measures for each segment. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. We consider NOI useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical consolidated operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.
Interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general, administrative and professional fees, income tax expense and other non-property-specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual reportable business segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. There are
no
intersegment sales or transfers.

Unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and other similar terms in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Ventas, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Cautionary Statements
Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated results from operations and developments and other matters that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers’ intent, belief or expectation as identified by the use of words such as “assume,” “may,” “will,” “project,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “target,” “forecast,” “plan,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “estimate,” “could,” “would,” “should” and other comparable and derivative terms or the negatives thereof.
Forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events. You should not put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We urge you to carefully review the disclosures we make concerning risks and uncertainties that may affect our business and future financial performance, including those made below and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as in the sections titled “Cautionary Statements — Summary Risk Factors,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Certain factors that could affect our future results and our ability to achieve our stated goals include, but are not limited to: (a) the impact and extended consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and other viruses and infections, such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus, on our revenue, level of profitability, liquidity and overall risk exposure and the implementation and impact of regulations related to the CARES Act and other stimulus legislation and any future COVID-19 relief measures, including the risk that some or all of the CARES Act or other COVID-19 relief payments we or our tenants, managers or borrowers received could be recouped; (b) our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits and synergies from, and effectively integrate, our completed or anticipated acquisitions and investments, including our ownership of the properties that previously supported our cash-pay non-recourse mezzanine loan to Santerre Health Investors; (c) our exposure and the exposure of our tenants, managers and borrowers to complex healthcare and other regulation and the challenges and expense associated with complying with such regulation; (d) the potential for significant general and commercial claims, legal actions, regulatory proceedings or enforcement actions that could subject us or our tenants, managers or borrowers to increased operating costs, uninsured liabilities fines or significant operational limitations, including the loss or suspension of or moratoriums on accreditations, licenses or certificates of need, suspension of new admissions, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs or the closure of facilities or communities; (e) the impact of market and general economic conditions on us and our tenants, managers and borrowers, including economic and financial market events, such as bank failures and other events affecting financial institutions, market volatility, increases in inflation, changes in interest rates and exchange rates, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit or capital, geopolitical conditions, supply chain pressures, rising labor costs and historically low unemployment, events that affect consumer confidence, our occupancy rates and resident fee revenues, and the actual and perceived state of the real estate markets, labor markets and public and private capital markets; (f) our reliance and the reliance of our tenants, managers and borrowers on the financial, credit and capital markets and the risk that those markets may be disrupted or become constrained, including as a result of bank failures or concerns or rumors about such events, tightening of lending standards and reduced availability of credit or capital; (g) our ability, and the ability of our tenants, managers and borrowers, to navigate the trends impacting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate; (h) the risk of bankruptcy, inability to obtain benefits from governmental programs, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors which may, among other things, have an adverse impact on the ability of such parties to pay obligations due to us or our financial results and financial condition; (i) the risk that the borrowers under our loans or other investments default or that, to the extent we are able to foreclose or otherwise acquire the collateral securing our loans or other investments, we will be required to incur additional expense or indebtedness in connection therewith, that the assets will underperform expectations or that we may not be able to subsequently dispose of all or part of such assets on favorable terms; (j) the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges are inherently uncertain, may increase or decrease in the future and may not represent or reflect the ultimate value of, or
30
loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant assets, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition; (k) the non-renewal of any leases or management agreement or defaults by tenants or managers thereunder and the risk of our inability to replace those tenants or managers on favorable terms, if at all; (l) our ability to identify and consummate future investments in or dispositions of healthcare assets and effectively manage our portfolio opportunities and our investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures and minority interests, including our ability to dispose of such assets on favorable terms as a result of rights of first offer or rights of first refusal in favor of third parties; (m) risks related to development, redevelopment and construction projects, including costs associated with inflation, rising interest rates, labor conditions and supply chain pressures; (n) our ability to attract and retain talented employees; (o) the limitations and significant requirements imposed upon our business as a result of our status as a REIT and the adverse consequences (including the possible loss of our status as a REIT) that would result if we are not able to comply with such requirements; (p) the risk of changes in healthcare law or regulation or in tax laws, guidance and interpretations, particularly as applied to REITs, that could adversely affect us or our tenants, managers or borrowers; (q) increases in our borrowing costs as a result of becoming more leveraged, including in connection with acquisitions or other investment activity and rising interest rates; (r) our reliance on third parties to operate a majority of our assets and our limited control and influence over such operations and results; (s) our dependency on a limited number of tenants and managers for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income; (t) the availability, adequacy and pricing of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our tenants, managers or other counterparties; (u) the occurrence of cyber incidents that could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or damage our business relationships and reputation; (v) the impact of merger, acquisition and investment activity in the healthcare industry or otherwise affecting our tenants, managers or borrowers; (w) disruptions to the management and operations of our business and the uncertainties caused by activist investors; (x) the risk of catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change; (y) the risk of potential dilution resulting from future sales or issuances of our equity securities; and (z) the other factors set forth in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Company Overview
Ventas, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust operating at the intersection of healthcare and real estate. We hold a highly diversified portfolio of senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, which we generally refer to collectively as “healthcare real estate,” located throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2023, we owned or had investments in approximately 1,400 properties (including properties classified as held for sale). Our company was originally founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.
We primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets through wholly-owned subsidiaries and other co-investment entities. We operate through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as “SHOP” and which was formerly known as senior living operations, and outpatient medical and research portfolio, which was formerly known as office operations. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including “Note 2 – Accounting Policies” and “Note 15 – Segment Information,” included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our senior housing communities are either subject to triple-net leases, in which case they are included in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, or operated by third-party managers, in which case they are included in our SHOP reportable business segment.
As of September 30, 2023, we leased a total of 335 properties (excluding properties within our outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segment) to various healthcare operating companies under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Our three largest tenants, Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Brookdale Senior Living”), Ardent Health Partners, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Ardent”) and Kindred Healthcare, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Kindred”) leased from us 121 properties, 30 properties (including 19 outpatient medical buildings) and 29 properties, respectively, as of September 30, 2023.
31
As of September 30, 2023, pursuant to long-term management agreements, we engaged operators, such as Atria Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, including Holiday Retirement (“Holiday”), “Atria”) and Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Sunrise”), to manage 594 senior housing communities in our SHOP reportable business segment.
As of September 30, 2023, we owned or had investments in 461 properties in our outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segment. These properties generally consist of outpatient medical buildings that are predominantly located on or contiguous to a health system campus and research properties that are affiliated with and often located on or contiguous to a university or academic medical campus. Through our Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc. (“Lillibridge”) subsidiary and our ownership interest in PMB Real Estate Services LLC (“PMBRES”), we also provide outpatient medical building management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems throughout the United States.
In addition, from time to time, we make secured and unsecured loans and other investments relating to healthcare real estate or operators.
We have a third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”), which includes our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in healthcare real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner.
We aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns through a strategy of (1) generating reliable and growing cash flows, (2) maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio of high-quality assets and (3) preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.
Our ability to access capital in a timely and cost-effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. Factors such as general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the trading price of our common stock impact our access to and cost of external capital. For that reason, we generally attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in real property with long-term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long-term fixed rate debt.
2023 Highlights
Continuing Impact of and Response to COVID-19 and Its Extended Consequences
Starting in 2020, our business was significantly impacted by both the COVID-19 pandemic itself, including actions taken to prevent the spread of the virus and its variants, and its extended consequences. The trajectory and future impact of COVID-19 remains highly uncertain. The extent of COVID-19’s continuing and ultimate effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the impact of new variants of the virus and the effectiveness of available vaccines against those variants; ongoing clinical experience, which may differ considerably across governmental and regulatory bodies and regions and fluctuate over time; and on other future developments, including the ultimate duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak, the availability of testing, the extent to which governments impose, roll-back or re-impose preventative restrictions and the availability of ongoing government financial support to our business, tenants and operators. Due to these uncertainties, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Investments and Dispositions
•
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we committed to an outpatient medical ground-up development located on the Sutter Roseville Medical Center campus in Roseville, California. The $61.8 million project includes the development of a new class A outpatient medical building and is 100% pre-leased to affiliates of Sutter Health for a 15-year lease term.
•
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold seven senior housing communities (four of which were vacant), five outpatient medical buildings, two research center, nine triple-net leased properties (two of which were vacant) and a land parcel for aggregate consideration of $167.3 million and recognized a net gain on the sale of these assets of $22.3 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
32
•
On May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that supported our cash-pay non-recourse mezzanine loan to Santerre Health Investors (the “Santerre Mezzanine Loan”) by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. As a result, the Santerre Mezzanine Loan is no longer outstanding. The properties consisted of a diverse pool of outpatient medical buildings, senior housing operating portfolio communities, triple-net leased skilled nursing facilities and hospital assets in the United States, which, at the time, also secured a $1 billion non-recourse senior mortgage loan issued under the CHC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2019-CHC (the “CHC Mortgage Loan”).
In connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reversed the $20.0 million allowance recognized as of December 31, 2022 and recognized a gain on foreclosure of real estate of $29.1 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The gain is the fair value of the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, less the fair value of the CHC Mortgage Loan, less the principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023 (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of non-real estate assets and liabilities and transaction costs.
Liquidity and Capital
•
As of September 30, 2023, we had over $3.1 billion in liquidity, including availability under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, with no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.
•
In March 2023, we entered into a new five year C$271.8 million mortgage loan secured by 14 SHOP communities in Canada at an effective fixed rate of 4.36%.
•
In the first quarter of 2023, we hedged an incremental $200.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt through the execution in March 2023 of two-year $400.0 million notional swaps on our unsecured term loan due in June 2027, replacing a $200.0 million notional swap that matured in January 2023.
•
In March and April 2023, we entered into a total of $250.0 million aggregate forward starting swaps with a ten-year weighted average rate of 3.37%. In July 2023, we terminated these swaps in conjunction with the issuance of $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan due in 2033.
•
In April 2023, our 100% owned subsidiary, Ventas Canada Finance Limited (“Ventas Canada”), issued and sold C$600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.398% Senior Notes due 2028 in a private placement at par. Pursuant to cash tender offers, we used the proceeds to repurchase C$613.7 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes due in 2024 for an aggregate purchase price of C$600.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date. As a result of the tender offers, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $8.3 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
•
On May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that supported the Santerre Mezzanine Loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. The properties consisted of a diverse pool of 153 assets, which, at the time, also secured the CHC Mortgage Loan. At the time of the equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, there was $1 billion outstanding under the CHC Mortgage Loan and it accrued interest at a weighted average rate of LIBOR + 1.84% and had matured on June 9, 2023. The CHC Mortgage Loan was recorded at fair value, which approximates par, on May 1, 2023.
On June 8, 2023, we voluntary prepaid, without penalty, $656.6 million of the CHC Mortgage Loan. In connection with the prepayment, 83 properties were released from the collateral securing the CHC Mortgage Loan.
On June 9, 2023, we extended the maturity date of the CHC Mortgage Loan to June 9, 2024 and amended the CHC Mortgage Loan to replace its LIBOR-based rates with SOFR-based rates.
In August 2023, we repaid the remaining balance of the CHC Mortgage Loan of $360.2 million at which time the CHC Mortgage Loan was no longer outstanding.
•
In June 2023, Ventas Realty issued $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”) in a private placement. The Exchangeable Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Ventas Realty and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Ventas. The Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June
33
1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2023. The Exchangeable Notes mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. The net proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes were primarily used to repay the CHC Mortgage Loan. As of September 30, 2023, we had $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes outstanding.
•
On September 6, 2023, Ventas Realty entered into a $200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at SOFR plus 0.95%, which is subject to adjustment based on Ventas Realty’s debt ratings. This term loan matures in February 2027. The term loan is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc.
•
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 2.3 million shares of our common stock under our ATM program for gross proceeds of $110.4 million, representing an average price of $47.89 per share. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining amount available under our ATM program for future sales of common stock was $889.6 million.
•
In July 2023, we entered into a $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan, which accrues interest at 5.91%, matures in 2033 and is secured by 19 SHOP communities in the United States. In October 2023, we purchased a $32.0 million tranche of this Company indebtedness at a discounted price, reducing the net effective interest rate of the mortgage loan to 5.60% and the net amount of the mortgage loan to $394.8 million.
Other Items
•
As of September 30, 2023, we held a 7.5% ownership interest in Ardent, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appoint one member to the Ardent Board of Directors. In May 2023, we sold approximately 24% of our ownership interest in Ardent to a third-party investor for $50.1 million in total proceeds. As a result of the sale, we recognized $33.5 million of gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income and our ownership interest in Ardent was reduced from 9.8% to 7.5%.
•
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $14.5 million of other income (which offsets other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income) relating to insurance reimbursements received for damage caused by materially disruptive events, primarily winter storm Elliott.

Concentration Risk
We use concentration ratios to identify, understand and evaluate the potential impact of economic downturns and other adverse events that may affect our asset types, geographic locations, business models, and tenants, operators and managers. We evaluate concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. Investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager. Operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant, operator or manager, geographic location or business model.

Triple-Net Lease Performance and Expirations
Any failure, inability or unwillingness by our tenants to satisfy their obligations under our triple-net leases could have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if our tenants are not able or willing to renew our triple-net leases upon expiration, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms, if at all. Although our lease expirations are staggered, the non-renewal of some or all of our triple-net leases that expire in any given year could have a material adverse effect on us. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had no triple-net lease renewals or expirations without renewal that, in the aggregate, had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for that period.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the SEC instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Our 2022 Annual Report contains additional information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to these policies in 2023.
Results of Operations
As of September 30, 2023, we operated through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, SHOP and outpatient medical and research portfolio. In our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, we invest in and own senior housing and healthcare properties throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. In our SHOP reportable business segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators, such as Atria and Sunrise, to manage those communities. In our outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. Information provided for “non-segment” includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. Assets included in “non-segment” consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments, and miscellaneous accounts receivable.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on net operating income (“NOI”) and related measures for each segment. For further information regarding our reportable business segments and a discussion of our definition of NOI, see “Note 15 – Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.

Resident fees and services include all amounts earned from residents at our senior housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. Property-level operating expenses related to our SHOP reportable business segment include labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other costs of operating the properties. For senior housing communities in our SHOP reportable business segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit occupancy for the reporting period. Average monthly revenue per occupied room reflects average resident fees and services per operator-reported occupied unit for the reporting period.
The NOI increase in our SHOP reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was driven by positive trends in revenue per occupied room and occupancy in 2023, properties acquired in connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan and communities that transitioned business model from our triple net lease properties. The NOI increase is partially offset by moderating operating expense growth in 2023, driven by macro inflationary impacts on labor in 2023 and HHS grants received in 2022, which are reflected as a reduction in property-level operating expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, HHS grants received reduced property-level operating expenses by zero and $20.2 million, respectively.

In our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, our revenues generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms. We report revenues and property-level operating expenses within our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment for real estate tax and insurance expenses that are paid from escrows collected from our tenants.
The NOI increase in our triple-net leased properties for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily driven by properties acquired in connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan and contractual rent escalators, partially offset by rental income from communities that transitioned business model to our senior housing operating portfolio and dispositions.
Occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants’ operations. For senior housing communities and post-acute properties in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit and bed occupancy, respectively, for the reporting period. Because triple-net financials are delivered to us following the reporting period, occupancy is reported in arrears. The following table sets forth average continuing occupancy rates for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The table excludes non-stabilized properties, properties owned through investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, certain properties for which we do not receive occupancy information and properties acquired or properties that transitioned operators for which we do not have a full quarter of occupancy results.

The NOI increase in our same-store triple-net leased portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily driven by contractual rent escalators.

NOI—Non-Segment
Information provided for non-segment NOI includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses, related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. The $10.5 million decrease in non-segment NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to a $11.5 million decrease in interest income from loans receivable and investments driven by a $10.7 million decrease due to the conversion of the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity in May 2023.
Company Results
Interest and Other Income
The $2.3 million increase in interest and other income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to interest income earned on cash on deposit in money market funds holding short-term U.S. Treasuries.
Interest Expense
The $28.5 million increase in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to an increase of $19.1 million due to higher effective interest rate and an increase of $11.3 million due to higher debt balances. Our weighted average debt outstanding was $13.5 billion and $12.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our weighted average effective interest rate was 4.33% and 3.72% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capitalized interest was $3.9 million and $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization
The $68.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to a $47.4 million increase in impairments recognized in the third quarter of 2023 primarily related to properties that were classified as held for sale or sold and a $26.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan received on May 1, 2023.
General, Administrative and Professional Fees
General, administrative and professional fees for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was relatively flat.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net
Loss on extinguishment of debt, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was relatively flat.
Transaction Expenses and Deal Costs
The $2.3 million increase in transaction expenses and deal costs for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to higher costs in 2023 related to deal costs and integration costs for the properties received in connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan.
Allowance on Loans Receivable and Investments
Allowance on loans receivable and investments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was relatively flat.
42
Other
The $0.3 million change in other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to an increase of $4.1 million in unrealized loss on stock warrants received in connection with the Brookdale Senior Living lease modification in the third quarter of 2020. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized unrealized losses of $5.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the stock warrants was $34.9 million, which was $6.8 million higher than the value at the grant date. The $4.1 million increase in unrealized loss on stock warrants was partially offset by an increase of $3.8 million of other income relating to insurance reimbursements received during the three months ended September 30, 2023, net of expenses, for damage caused by materially disruptive events, primarily winter storm Elliott.
(Loss) Income from Unconsolidated Entities
The $7.1 million change in loss from unconsolidated entities for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to our share of higher net loss from the Research & Innovation Development Joint Venture due to lower capitalized interest and higher depreciation for development assets placed in service in 2023, partially offset by higher NOI in 2023.
Gain on Real Estate Dispositions
The $10.6 million change in gain on real estate dispositions for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to dispositions of real estate during the third quarter of 2023, which resulted in the recognition of a gain on sale of $10.7 million.
Income Tax Benefit
The $1.7 million income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $8.0 million benefit from internal restructurings of U.S. TRS entities. The $6.0 million income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $2.0 million benefit from an internal restructuring of a U.S. TRS.

The NOI increase in our SHOP reportable business segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily driven by positive trends in revenue per occupied room and occupancy, properties acquired in connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan and communities that transitioned business model from our triple net lease properties. The NOI increase is partially offset by higher operating expenses in 2023, driven by HHS grants received in 2022, which are reflected as a reduction in property-level operating expenses, and macro inflationary impacts on labor in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, HHS grants received reduced property-level operating expenses by zero and $53.1 million, respectively.

NOI—Non-Segment
The $11.4 million decrease in non-segment NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to a $11.9 million decrease in interest income from loans receivable and investments driven by a $9.7 million decrease due to the conversion of the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity in May 2023 and a $4.3 million decrease due to a $43.4 million loan investment that was repaid at par in February 2023, partially offset by $1.8 million of higher income from loans receivable originated in late 2022.
Company Results
Interest and Other Income
The $3.3 million increase in interest and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to interest income earned on cash on deposit in money market funds holding short-term U.S. Treasuries.
Interest Expense
The $75.1 million increase in interest expense, net of capitalized interest, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to an increase of $56.0 million due to higher effective interest rate and $18.0 million due to higher debt balances. Our weighted average debt outstanding was $13.0 billion and $12.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our weighted average effective interest rate was 4.19% and
47
3.58% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capitalized interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $9.5 million and $7.2 million, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization
The $83.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 is primarily due to a $46.2 million increase in impairments recognized in 2023 primarily related to properties that were classified as held for sale or sold and a $45.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan received on May 1, 2023.
General, Administrative and Professional Fees
General, administrative and professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was relatively flat.
Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt, Net
The $6.8 million change in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to $8.3 million of gain recognized as a result of the April 2023 cash tender offers.
Transaction Expenses and Deal Costs
The $26.3 million decrease in transaction expenses and deal costs was primarily attributable to $20.5 million incurred in connection with stockholder relations matters in 2022 and lower costs associated with operator transitions in 2023, partially offset by integration costs for the properties received in connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan.
Allowance on Loans Receivable and Investments
In connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023, we derecognized the allowance previously recorded and reversed $20.0 million of allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Santerre Mezzanine Loan is no longer outstanding.
Gain on Foreclosure of Real Estate
The gain of $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was recorded in connection with our equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023 and is the excess of the fair value of the properties that secured the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, less the fair value of the CHC Mortgage Loan, less the principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan on May 1, 2023 (after the reversal of previously recorded allowances), and net of non-real estate assets and liabilities and transaction costs.
Other
The $30.9 million change in other expense was primarily due to a $22.0 million change relating to changes in fair value of stock warrants received in connection with the Brookdale Senior Living lease modification in the third quarter of 2020. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized an unrealized gain of $11.3 million and an unrealized loss of $10.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the stock warrants was $34.9 million, which was $6.8 million higher than the value at the grant date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we also recognized an increase of $8.3 million of other income relating to insurance reimbursements received, net of expenses, for damage caused by materially disruptive events, primarily winter storm Elliott.
Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities
The $23.9 million change in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to a $33.5 million gain recognized upon the sale of approximately 24% of our 9.8% ownership interest in Ardent to a third-party investor in May 2023, partially offset by our share of higher net loss from the Research & Innovation Development Joint Venture due to lower capitalized interest and higher depreciation for development assets placed in service in 2023, partially offset by higher NOI in 2023.
48
Gain on Real Estate Dispositions
The $19.8 million increase in gain on real estate dispositions was primarily due to a net gain of $22.3 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the sale of 23 properties and a land parcel, partially offset by a net gain of $2.6 million in 2022 for the sale of a vacant land parcel and a vacant office building.
Income Tax Benefit
The $14.2 million of income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $8.0 million benefit from internal restructurings of U.S. TRS entities. The $14.3 million of income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities and a $2.0 million benefit from an internal restructuring of a U.S. TRS.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We consider certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
The non-GAAP financial measures we present in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. You should not consider these measures as alternatives for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine these measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP measures as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, we consider Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. We believe that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. We believe that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.
We use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We define Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction expenses and deal costs, including transaction, integration and severance-related costs and expenses, and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and including Ventas’ share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or
49
premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on our Consolidated Statements of Income and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.
The following table summarizes our FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands). Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 over the same period in 2022 includes $54.2 million of HHS grants received in 2022, which reduced property-level operating expenses. Excluding HHS grants, Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased over the same period in 2022 due to increased net operating income from our properties led by our SHOP reportable business segment as a result of increased revenues driven by positive trends in occupancy and revenue per occupied room, partially offset by higher interest expense.

NOI
We also consider NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess our unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.

See “Results of Operations” for discussions regarding both NOI and same-store NOI. We define same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that we may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in our judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of our segment performance.
Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in our SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Our senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.
Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.
51
To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, and proceeds from asset sales.
For the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt; (iv) fund acquisitions, investments and commitments and any development and redevelopment activities; (v) fund capital expenditures; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Depending upon the availability of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. We expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. However, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, and operating obligations which include ground lease obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our contractual obligations increased primarily due to the issuance of $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026. See “Note 9 – Senior Notes Payable And Other Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding our significant debt activities.
We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding indebtedness for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for capital and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
Loans Receivable and Investments
On May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that supported the Santerre Mezzanine Loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. As a result, the Santerre Mezzanine Loan is no longer outstanding.
Credit Facilities, Commercial Paper, Unsecured Term Loans and Letters of Credit
As of September 30, 2023, we had $2.7 billion of undrawn capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility with $31.7 million outstanding and an additional $1.2 million restricted to support outstanding letters of credit. We limit our use of the unsecured revolving credit facility, to the extent necessary, to support our commercial paper program when commercial paper notes are outstanding.
As of September 30, 2023, our $100.0 million uncommitted line for standby letters of credit had an outstanding balance of $15.0 million. The agreement governing the line contains certain customary covenants and, under its terms, we are required to pay a commission on each outstanding letter of credit at a fixed rate.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”), may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.0 billion. The notes are sold under customary terms in the U.S. commercial paper note market and are ranked pari passu with all of Ventas Realty’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. As of September 30, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.
Ventas Realty has a $500.0 million unsecured term loan priced at Term SOFR plus 0.95%, which is subject to adjustment based on Ventas Realty’s debt ratings. This term loan is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. It matures in June 2027 and includes an accordion feature that permits Ventas Realty to increase the aggregate borrowings
52
thereunder to up to $1.25 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase.
On September 6, 2023, Ventas Realty entered into a $200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at SOFR plus 0.95%, which is subject to adjustment based on Ventas Realty’s debt ratings. This term loan is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. It matures in February 2027 and includes an accordion feature that permits Ventas Realty to increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to $500.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase.
As of September 30, 2023, Ventas Canada Finance Limited, Ventas SSL Ontario II, Inc. and Ventas SSL Ontario III, Inc., as borrowers, had a C$500.0 million unsecured term loan facility priced at Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) plus 0.90% that matures in January 2025.
Exchangeable Senior Notes
In June 2023, Ventas Realty issued $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Exchangeable Notes”) in a private placement. The Exchangeable Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Ventas Realty and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Ventas. The Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2023. The Exchangeable Notes mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. The net proceeds from the Exchangeable Notes were primarily used to repay the CHC Mortgage Loan. As of September 30, 2023, we had $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes outstanding.
The Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 18.2460 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $54.81 per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment, including in the event of the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of $0.45 per share, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes, Ventas Realty will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Ventas Realty’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes being exchanged. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2026, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods described in the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes. On or after March 1, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods.
Senior Notes
In April 2023, our 100% owned subsidiary, Ventas Canada Finance Limited (“Ventas Canada”), issued and sold C$600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.398% Senior Notes due 2028 in a private placement at par. Pursuant to cash tender offers, we used the proceeds to repurchase C$613.7 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes due in 2024 for an aggregate purchase price of C$600.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest as disclosed below:
•
In April 2023, we repurchased C$527.0 million principal amount of our 2.80% Senior Notes, Series E due April 2024 at 97.6% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date.
•
In April 2023, we repurchased C$86.7 million principal amount of our 4.125% Senior Notes, Series B due September 2024 at 98.5% of par value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date.
As a result of the tender offers, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of $8.3 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Mortgages
In March 2023, we entered into a C$271.8 million floating rate mortgage loan maturing in 2028 with an interest rate of CDOR + 0.88%. The mortgage is secured by 14 SHOP communities in Canada.
53
On May 1, 2023, we took ownership of the properties that supported the Santerre Mezzanine Loan by converting the outstanding principal amount of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to equity, with no additional consideration being paid. The properties consisted of a diverse pool of 153 assets, which, at the time, also secured the CHC Mortgage Loan. At the time of the equitization of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, there was $1 billion outstanding under the CHC Mortgage Loan and it accrued interest at a weighted average rate of LIBOR + 1.84% and had matured on June 9, 2023. The CHC Mortgage Loan was recorded at fair value, which approximates par, on May 1, 2023.
On June 8, 2023, we voluntary prepaid, without penalty, $656.6 million of the CHC Mortgage Loan. In connection with the prepayment, 83 properties were released from the collateral securing the CHC Mortgage Loan.
On June 9, 2023, we extended the maturity date of the CHC Mortgage Loan to June 9, 2024 and amended the CHC Mortgage Loan to replace its LIBOR-based rates with SOFR-based rates.
In August 2023, we repaid the remaining balance of the CHC Mortgage Loan of $360.2 million at which time the CHC Mortgage Loan was no longer outstanding.
In July 2023, we entered into a $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan, which accrues interest at 5.91%, matures in 2033 and is secured by 19 SHOP communities in the United States. In October 2023, we purchased a $32.0 million tranche of this Company indebtedness at a discounted price, reducing the net effective interest rate of the mortgage loan to 5.60% and the net amount of the mortgage loan to $394.8 million.
Equity Offerings
From time to time, we may sell our common stock under an “at-the-market” equity offering program (“ATM program”). During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 1.8 million shares of our common stock under our ATM program for gross proceeds of $84.8 million, representing an average price of $48.19 per share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 2.3 million shares of our common stock under our ATM program for gross proceeds of $110.4 million, representing an average price of $47.89 per share. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining amount available under our ATM program for future sales of common stock was $889.6 million.
Derivatives and Hedging
In the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our operating results. We follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks.
In the first quarter of 2023, we hedged an incremental $200.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt through the execution in March 2023 of two-year $400.0 million notional swaps on our unsecured term loan due in June 2027, replacing a $200.0 million notional swap that matured in January 2023. The swap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
In March 2023, in connection with our new C$271.8 million mortgage loan, we entered into an interest rate swap totaling a notional amount of C$271.8 million with a maturity of March 14, 2028 that effectively converts CDOR-based floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
In March and April 2023, we entered into a total of $250.0 million aggregate forward starting swaps with a ten-year weighted average rate of 3.37%. In July 2023, we terminated the above-mentioned forward starting swaps in conjunction with the issuance of the $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan due in 2033.
Dividends
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we declared a dividend of $0.45 per share of our common stock in each of the first and second quarter. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). In addition, we will be subject to income tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains. We intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2023.
54
We expect that our cash flows will exceed our REIT taxable income due to depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income and that we will be able to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. However, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities decreased $12.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher interest expense and no HHS grants received in 2023, partially offset by higher property NOI in 2023, and higher transaction expenses and deal costs in 2022 in connection with stockholder relations matters.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $583.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher acquisition volume in 2022, and higher proceeds from real estate dispositions and sale of approximately 24% of our ownership interest in Ardent in 2023, partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2023.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities increased $253.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher debt repayments and higher repayments under our commercial paper program in 2023, partially offset by higher proceeds from debt.
55
Capital Expenditures
The terms of our triple-net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay all capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties. However, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans or advances to the tenants, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases. We may also fund capital expenditures for which we may become responsible upon expiration of our triple-net leases or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases. We also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our SHOP and outpatient medical and research portfolio reportable business segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. We expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program.
To the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness.
We are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop senior housing or healthcare properties funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. As of September 30, 2023, we had seven active and committed projects pursuant to these agreements, including three projects that are unconsolidated.
In addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing senior housing communities to maximize the value, increase NOI, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We own interests in certain unconsolidated entities as described in “Note 6 – Investments In Unconsolidated Entities.” Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under “Note 9 – Senior Notes Payable And Other Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. Further, we use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Finally, at September 30, 2023, we had $16.2 million outstanding letters of credit obligations. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above.
Guarantor and Issuer Financial Information
Ventas, Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes issued by our 100% owned subsidiary, Ventas Realty. None of our other subsidiaries is obligated with respect to Ventas Realty’s outstanding senior notes.
Ventas, Inc. has also fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes, including the Exchangeable Notes, issued by our 100% owned subsidiary, Ventas Canada Finance Limited (“Ventas Canada”). None of our other subsidiaries is obligated with respect to Ventas Canada’s outstanding senior notes, all of which were issued on a private placement basis in Canada.
In connection with the acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. (“NHP”), our 100% owned subsidiary Nationwide Health Properties, LLC (“NHP LLC”), as successor to NHP, assumed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes issued by NHP. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries (other than NHP LLC) is obligated with respect to any of NHP LLC’s outstanding senior notes.
In addition, Ventas, Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under our $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, our C$500.0 million unsecured term loan facility, our $500.0 million unsecured term loan, our $200.0 million unsecured term loan and our $100.0 million uncommitted line for standby letters of credit.
Under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries’ outstanding mortgage indebtedness, may restrict our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries for the

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The following discussion of our exposure to various market risks contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to us. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates and other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking information.
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and our unsecured term loans, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and available for sale securities. These market risks result primarily from changes in benchmark interest rates. To manage these risks, we continuously monitor our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of current and future economic conditions.
As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of our secured and non-mortgage loans receivable, based on our estimates of current prevailing rates for comparable loans, was $51.2 million and $517.0 million, respectively.
The fair value of our fixed rate debt is based on current market interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. Increases in market interest rates typically result in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates typically result in an increase in the fair value of fixed rate date. While changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, these changes do not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt.  Therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. If interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs.
To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points in interest rates (dollars in thousands):

The variable rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $143.7 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities on March 2027, that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. In addition, the fixed rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $537.2 million and C$561.3 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from October 2023 to April 2031, in each case, that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.
In the first quarter of 2023, we hedged an incremental $200.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt through the execution in March 2023 of two-year $400.0 million notional swaps on our unsecured term loan due in June 2027, replacing a $200.0 million notional swap that matured in January 2023. The swap instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
The decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt at September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to pay downs on our commercial paper.
59
The increase in our outstanding fixed rate debt at September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 is primarily attributable to the issuance of $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026, the issuance of a $426.8 million fixed rate mortgage loan, which accrues interest at 5.91%, matures in 2033 and is secured by 19 SHOP communities in the United States, and interest rate swap activity in 2023 effectively converting an incremental $200.0 million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.
Assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our consolidated variable rate debt and assuming no change in our consolidated variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2023 of $1.1 billion, interest expense on an annualized basis would increase by approximately $11.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share.
As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our joint venture partners’ aggregate share of total consolidated debt was $295.7 million and $279.0 million, respectively, with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures.
Total consolidated debt does not include our portion of unconsolidated debt related to investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, which was $564.5 million and $454.4 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
As a result of our Canadian and United Kingdom operations, we are subject to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and operating performance. Based solely on our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (including the impact of existing hedging arrangements), if the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar were to increase or decrease by one standard deviation compared to the average exchange rate during the year, our Normalized FFO per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 would decrease or increase as applicable, by $0.01 per share or 1%. We will continue to mitigate these risks through a layered approach to hedging looking out for the next year and continual assessment of our foreign operational capital structure.  Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have an effect on our earnings.
