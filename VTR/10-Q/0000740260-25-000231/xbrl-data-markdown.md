| Asset Acquisition Text Block | NOTE 4—ACQUISITIONS OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTYWe acquire and invest in senior housing, outpatient medical buildings, research centers and other healthcare properties primarily to achieve an expected yield on our investment, to grow and diversify our portfolio and revenue base and to reduce our dependence on any single manager or tenant, geographic location, asset type, business model or revenue source. Each of our acquisitions disclosed below was accounted for as an asset acquisition. | c-1 |  |
| Basis Of Accounting Policy Policy Text Block | The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods have been included.  Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2025. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 Annual Report”). | c-1 |  |

| Concentration Risk Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 3—CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKWe use total revenues and total NOI in assessing our concentration of credit risk. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to total NOI.We are exposed to the credit risk of our tenants in our NNN and OM&R segments because those tenants are obligated to pay us rent and, in certain instances, pay or reimburse us for some or all property-related expenses, including utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning, roads and grounds expense and other expenses. Because we engage independent managers to manage the properties in our SHOP segment in exchange for a management fee, we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as the tenants in our NNN and OM&R segments. | c-1 |  |
| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. | c-1 |  |

| Fair Value Disclosures Text Block | NOTE 11—FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSOverviewAccounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:•Level 1: Fair value calculated based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access.•Level 2: Fair value calculated using inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other inputs for the asset or liability that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves.•Level 3: Fair value calculated using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which typically are based on our own assumptions, because there is little, if any, related market activity.The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange or transaction.Financial Instruments Measured at Fair ValueThe table below summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments either recorded or disclosed on a recurring basis (dollars in thousands):As of June 30, 2025As of December 31, 2024Carrying AmountFair ValueCarrying AmountFair ValueAssets:Cash and cash equivalents(1)$614,200$614,200$897,850$897,850Escrow deposits and restricted cash(1)62,55762,55759,38359,383Secured loans receivable and investments, net(3)(4)183,652184,534144,872146,229Non-mortgage loans receivable, net(3)(4)(5)20,91520,52828,12927,640Derivative instruments(3)(4)(5)22,28622,28653,10053,100Liabilities:Senior notes payable and other debt, gross(3)(4)$13,154,874$13,135,881$13,618,802$13,411,066Derivative instruments(3)(6)7,3657,3655,8875,887Temporary Equity:Redeemable OP Units(2)$213,288$213,288$200,420$200,420______________________________(1)The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.(2)Level 1 within fair value hierarchy.(3)Level 2 within fair value hierarchy.(4)Level 3 within fair value hierarchy.(5)Included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.(6)Included in Accounts payable and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. | c-1 |  |

| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 13—INCOME TAXESWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for every year beginning with the year ended December 31, 1999. We have also elected for certain of our subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS” or “TRS entities”), which are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.  All entities other than the TRS entities are collectively referred to as the “REIT” within this note. Certain REIT entities are subject to foreign income tax.Although the TRS entities and certain other foreign entities have paid minimal federal, state and foreign income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2025, their income tax liabilities may increase in future periods as we exhaust net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and as our operations grow. Such increases could be significant.Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was an expense of $3.9million and $7.8million, respectively. Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 was a benefit of $6.7million and an expense of $4.8million, respectively. The income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2025 is primarily due to certain of our TRS entities incurring tax expense as a result of interest expense in excess of certain deduction thresholds, partially offset by the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our TRS entities. The income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2025 is primarily due to the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our TRS entities. The income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the enactment of Bill C-59 in Canada, which limits the amount of interest expense we can deduct with respect to our Canadian entities. Bill C-59 became effective in June 2024 and was retrospectively applied to the period beginning October 1, 2023. The cumulative tax effect of such interest limitation was recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The impact of the interest limitation was partially offset by the reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our TRS entities and losses in certain of our TRS entities.Each TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities with respect to our TRS entities totaled $14.0million and $8.2million as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and related primarily to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of fixed and intangible assets, net of loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets with respect to our TRS entities totaled $2.2million and $1.9million as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and related primarily to loss carryforwards.Generally, we are subject to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the year ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent years and are subject to audit by state taxing authorities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and subsequent years. We are subject to audit generally under the statutes of limitation by the Canada Revenue Agency and provincial authorities with respect to the Canadian entities for the year ended December 31, 2020 and subsequent years.  We are subject to audit in the United Kingdom generally for periods ended in and subsequent to 2023. | c-1 |  |

| Legal Matters And Contingencies Text Block | NOTE 12—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFrom time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in connection with our business. In certain circumstances, regardless of whether we are a named party in a lawsuit, investigation, claim or other legal or regulatory proceeding, we may be contractually obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our managers, tenants and borrowers or other third parties against, or may otherwise be responsible for, such actions, proceedings or claims. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims and employment claims, as well as regulatory proceedings and government investigations, including proceedings related to our senior housing operating portfolio, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license. These claims may not be fully insured and some may allege large damage amounts.It is the opinion of management, that the disposition of any such lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings that are currently pending will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on us. However, regardless of the merits of a particular action, investigation or claim, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources to defend and resolve these matters. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, and if management’s assessment of our liability with respect thereto is incorrect, such actions, investigations and claims could have a material adverse effect on us.From time to time, on behalf of ourselves or on behalf of our unconsolidated entities, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide guarantees, indemnities or other similar contingent obligations to third parties.  Such agreements may include, without limitation: (i) guarantees of all or a portion of the principal, interest and other amounts due under mortgage debt or other borrowings; (ii) customary nonrecourse carve-out guarantees provided in connection with mortgage or other borrowings; (iii) customary indemnifications of lenders for potential environmental liabilities; (iv) completion guarantees provided to lenders, tenants, ground lessors or other third parties for the completion of development and redevelopment projects; (v) guarantees of | c-1 |  |

| Nature Of Operations | NOTE 1—DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSVentas, Inc., (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ventas,” “Company” and other similar terms) is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on delivering strong, sustainable shareholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. We hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom. As of June 30, 2025, we owned or had investments in1,395properties consisting of1,357properties in our reportable business segments (“Segment Properties”) and38properties held by unconsolidated real estate entities in our non-segment operations. Our Company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999.  Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders.  In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate and manage our assets.We operate throughthreereportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we refer to as “SHOP,” outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we refer to as “OM&R,” and triple-net leased properties, which we refer to as “NNN.” We also hold assets outside of our reportable business segments, which we refer to as non-segment assets, and which consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional private capital management platform, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”). Our investments in unconsolidated entities also includes investments in operating entities, such as Ardent Health Partners, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Ardent”) and Atria Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Atria”).Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each operating segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments based on net operating income (“NOI”) for each segment. See “Note 16 – Segment Information.”The following table summarizes information for our portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2025 (dollars in thousands):SegmentNOI(1)Percentage of Total NOISegment PropertiesSenior housing operating portfolio (SHOP)$550,91647.6%683Outpatient medical and research portfolio (OM&R)292,52825.3415Triple-net leased properties (NNN)301,32226.0259Non-segment(2)12,6471.1n/a$1,157,413100.0%1,357______________________________(1)“NOI” is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses.

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | Recent Accounting StandardsIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09,Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures(“ASU 2023-09”), which requires public entities on an annual basis to (i) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (ii) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect to early adopt, expect to include additional required disclosures in our 2025 annual report on Form 10-K and are continuing to evaluate the impacts.In March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275,The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors, which requires registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The new rule would be effective for annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2025. In April 2024, the SEC exercised its discretion to stay this rule and subsequently, in March 2025, the SEC voted to end its defense of the rule against certain legal challenges. We are monitoring the ongoing judicial review of these legal challenges to determine the impact, if any, of the rule on our Consolidated Financial Statements.On November 4, 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (“DISE”), which requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities (“PBEs”). ASU 2024-03 requires PBEs to include footnote disclosure that disaggregates, in a tabular presentation, each relevant expense caption on the face of the income statement that includes certain natural expenses relevant to the Company, such as (i) employee compensation, (ii) depreciation and (iii) intangible asset amortization. The tabular disclosure must also include certain other expenses, when applicable. The ASU does not change the expense captions an entity presents on the face of the income statement; rather, it requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified categories in disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The requirements will be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. We are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. | c-1 |  |

| Segment Reporting Disclosure Text Block | NOTE 16—SEGMENT INFORMATIONAs of June 30, 2025, we operated throughthreereportable business segments: SHOP, OM&R and NNN. In our SHOP segment, we own and invest in senior housing communities and engage operators to operate those communities. In our OM&R segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers. In our NNN segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), long-term acute care facilities (“LTACs”), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and other healthcare facilities and lease these properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Information provided for “non-segment” includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional private capital management platform, income from loans and investments and corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of ourthreereportable business segments. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and accounts receivable. Total assets by reportable business segment is not disclosed as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) does not review such information to evaluate business performance and allocate resources.Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Our CODM evaluates performance of the combined properties in each operating segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments, based on NOI for each segment. Our CODM uses NOI to assess the performance of each segment and to allocate resources (including employees and financial or capital resources) primarily during the quarterly or annual business review and annual budget and forecasting process. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses.Interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general, administrative and professional fees, income tax expense and other non-property-specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual reportable business segments for purposes of assessing segment performance.

| Significant Accounting Policies Text Block | NOTE 2—ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods have been included.  Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2025. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 Annual Report”).Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.GAAP requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Substantially all of the assets of the VIEs are real estate investments and substantially all of the liabilities of the VIEs are mortgage loans. Assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of such VIEs. Liabilities of the consolidated VIEs represent claims against the specific assets of the VIEs.In general, mortgage loans of the consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to our non-VIE consolidated entities.The table below summarizes the total assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands):As of June 30, 2025As of December 31, 2024Total AssetsTotal LiabilitiesTotal AssetsTotal LiabilitiesFonds Immobilier Groupe Maurice, S.E.C.$1,865,286$1,176,023$1,779,762$1,121,659NHP/PMB L.P.724,737273,743728,457286,030Other identified VIEs1,451,378424,8271,447,381410,721 | c-1 |  |

Equity forward sales agreements generally have a maturity ofonetotwo years. At any time during the term of an equity forward sales agreement, we may settle that equity forward sales agreement by delivery of physical shares of our common stock to the forward purchaser or, at our election, subject to certain exceptions, we may settle in cash or by net share settlement. The forward sales price we expect to receive upon settlement of outstanding equity forward sales agreements will be the initial forward price, net of commissions, established on or shortly after the effective date of the relevant equity forward sales agreement, subject to adjustments for accrued interest, the forward purchasers’ stock borrowing costs in excess of a certain threshold specified in the equity forward sales agreement and certain fixed price reductions for expected dividends on our common stock during the term of the equity forward sales agreement.
