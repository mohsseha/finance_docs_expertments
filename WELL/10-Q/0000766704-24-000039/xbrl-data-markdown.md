| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | New Accounting StandardsIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-07"), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. We currently expect to provide the required significant segment expense disclosures, with no other changes to our consolidated financial statements, as a result of the new standard.In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09")," which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. | c-1 |  |

| Operating Leases Of Lessor Disclosure Text Block | LessorSubstantially all of our operating leases in which we are the lessor contain escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we wrote off previously recognized straight-line rent receivable and unamortized lease incentive balances of $97,674,000through a reduction of rental income, which related to leases for which the collection of substantially all contractual lease payments was no longer probable due primarily to agreements reached to convert Triple-net leased properties to Seniors Housing Operating RIDEA structures (see Note 19). During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we wrote off previously recognized straight-line rent receivable and unamortized lease incentive balances of$12,309,000for which collection was no longer deemed probable.Leases in our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical portfolios recognized under ASC 842, "Leases" ("ASC 842"), typically include some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized$1,183,949,000of rental income related to operating leases, of which$165,863,000was for variable lease payments that primarily represents the reimbursement of operating costs such as common area maintenance expenses, utilities, insurance and real estate taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized$1,152,005,000of rental income related to operating leases, of which$163,980,000was for variable lease payments.For the majority of our Seniors Housing Operating segment, revenue from resident fees and services is predominantly service-based, and as such, resident agreements are accounted for under ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." Within that reportable segment, we also recognize revenue from residential seniors apartment leases in accordance with ASC 842. The amount of revenue related to these leases was$417,490,000and $341,172,000for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.For sales-type leases, we record any selling profit or loss arising from leases at inception within gain (loss) on real estate dispositions and acquisitions of controlling interests, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The investments in sales-type leases, net represents the lease receivable, the components of which are the future lease payments and any guaranteed or unguaranteed residual value for the underlying assets expected at the end of the lease term, measured at the net present value discounted using a rate implicit in the lease. Interest income is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the lease term using the effective interest method. | c-1 |  |
