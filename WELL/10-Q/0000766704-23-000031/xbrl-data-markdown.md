| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | New Accounting StandardsIn March 2020, the FASB issued an amendment to the reference rate reform standard, which provides the option for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on contract modifications and hedge accounting. An example of such reform is the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. Entities that make this optional expedient election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess the accounting treatment if certain criteria are met and would continue applying hedge accounting for relationships affected by reference rate reform.In December 2022, the FASB extended the date for which this guidance can be applied from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. We continue to monitor developments related to the LIBOR transition and identification of an alternative, market-accepted rate. | c-1 |  |
