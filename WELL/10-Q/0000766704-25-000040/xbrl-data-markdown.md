| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | New Accounting StandardsIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09")," which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, "Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses." The ASU is intended to enhance transparency of income statement disclosures primarily through additional disaggregation of relevant expense captions. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with prospective or retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. | c-1 |  |

| Operating Leases Of Lessor Disclosure Text Block | LessorSubstantially all of our operating leases in which we are the lessor contain escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we wrote off previously recognizedstraight-line rent receivable and unamortized lease incentive balancesof $97,674,000through a reduction of rental income, which related to leases for which the collection of substantially all contractual lease payments was no longer probable due primarily to agreements reached to convert Triple-net leased properties to Seniors Housing Operating RIDEA structures.Leases in our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical portfolios recognized under ASC 842, "Leases" ("ASC 842"), typically include some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized $1,444,082,000of rental income related to operating leases, of which $167,865,000was for variable lease payments that primarily represents the reimbursement of operating costs such as common area maintenance expenses, utilities, insurance and real estate taxes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized$1,183,949,000of rental income related to operating leases, of which$165,863,000was for variable lease payments.For the majority of our Seniors Housing Operating segment, revenue from resident fees and services is predominantly service-based, and as such, resident agreements are accounted for under ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." Within that reportable segment, we also recognize revenue from residential seniors apartment leases in accordance with ASC 842. The amount of revenue related to these leases was $589,289,000and $417,490,000for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.On September 30, 2024, we reached agreements with our tenant to sell15properties, which were included intwomaster leases previously classified as operating leases. As a result of the agreement to sell the properties, thetwoleases were classified as sales-type leases in accordance with ASC 842 and a gain of $92,593,000was recognized in gains (losses) on real estate dispositions and acquisitions of controlling interests, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we sold11of the properties for net proceeds of $101,614,000, which was recognized in proceeds from sales of real property in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2025, we sold the remainingfourproperties for which the related master lease was classified as a sales-type lease. We recognized net proceeds of $174,824,000on the sale, which was included in proceeds from sales of real property in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. | c-1 |  |
