consisting of ~2,000 units, which were transitioned to StoryPoint Senior Living concurrent with closing • StoryPoint was selected to operate Danbury due to its track record of success in operating properties in high-end Midwest micro- markets
and integrating consumer-focused brands onto its management platform • In its most recent reporting period, Danbury attained 85.4% occupancy and 23.6% NOI margin which was ~1,300 bps and ~1,800 bps higher, respectively, than its pre-transition
period metrics • StoryPoint attributed the improved performance to strong execution by its transition team in integrating the assets into its Cleveland MSA broader portfolio and the significant operational synergies achieved due to the
proximity of the Danbury portfolio to its existing managed assets in the region Ohio The post-acquisition transition of the portfolio to StoryPoint has resulted in greater micromarket density, more efficient asset management, expense synergies, and

Supplemental Financial Measures
FFO and Normalized FFO Historical cost accounting for real estate
assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with
market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO attributable to common stockholders, as defined by NAREIT, means net income
attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in the reconciliations and described in our earnings press releases for the relevant periods.
We believe that Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare our operating performance between periods or to other
REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items. 30

NOI, IPNOI, SSNOI, RevPOR, ExpPOR, SS RevPOR & SS ExpPOR We define
NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not
limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general
overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation
of corporate fixed assets. IPNOI represents NOI excluding interest income, other income and non-IPNOI and adjusted for timing of current quarter portfolio changes such as acquisitions, development conversions, segment transitions, dispositions and
investments held for sale. SSNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those
revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in the same store amounts five full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service. Land
parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the period, are excluded from the same store amounts. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property
where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the
redevelopment. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the operator transition or segment transition. In addition, properties
significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from same store amounts until five full quarters after the properties are placed back into service. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes
adjustments to present consistent property ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and UK properties using a consistent exchange rate. Normalizers include adjustments that in management’s opinion are appropriate in
considering SSNOI, a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure. None of these adjustments, which may increase or decrease SSNOI, are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant normalizers (defined as
any that individually exceed 0.50% of SSNOI growth per property type) are separately disclosed and explained in the relevant supplemental reporting package. We believe NOI, IPNOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because
they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI, IPNOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties. No
reconciliation of the forecasted range for SSNOI on a combined basis or by property type is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable GAAP financial measure
without unreasonable efforts, and we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors. RevPOR represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at our Seniors
Housing Operating properties and ExpPOR represents the average expenses per occupied room per month at our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These metrics are calculated as the pro rata version of resident fees and services revenues or property
operating expenses per the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days. SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR are used to evaluate the RevPOR and ExpPOR performance of our properties under a consistent population, which eliminates changes in
the composition of our portfolio. They are based on the same pool of properties used for SSNOI and includes any revenue or expense normalizations used for SSNOI. We use RevPOR, ExpPOR, SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR to evaluate the revenue-generating
capacity and profit potential of our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates. They are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics, if known, to evaluate the quality of our Seniors
Housing Operating portfolio. 32
