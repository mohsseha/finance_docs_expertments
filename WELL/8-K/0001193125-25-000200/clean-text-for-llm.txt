Exhibit 99.1
TOLEDO, Ohio, January 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/  Welltower Inc. (NYSE: WELL) today announced executive and senior leadership team promotions to
further solidify its
best-in-class
team and to strengthen the Companys long-term growth prospects.
The transformation of Welltower and the progress we have made over the past decade would not have been possible without the dedication, contribution and
impact of the individuals being recognized today, said Shankh Mitra, Welltowers Chief Executive Officer. These promotions reflect their exceptional leadership as they embody the unique culture we have created. The cultivation
of the next generation of talent at the firm will add further duration to our dogged pursuit of long-term compounding of per share growth for our owners. Mr. Mitra added, All of these individuals have been instrumental in creating
what is known today as Welltower by laying one airtight brick at a time with an outsider mindset. Nikhil, Tim, Matt and John Olympitis are part of the original team who started this transformational journey with me almost a decade ago. Eddy, Patrick
and John Burkart subsequently joined us as we disrupted our company from within to the next iteration. But all of them share two rare genetic qualities: a delayed gratification gene referring to their instinctive bias towards sacrificing
an immediate reward for a much larger gain tomorrow and a fiduciary gene representing their innate desire to put the interests of our owners ahead of their own. I am humbled every day by their unwavering commitment to the long-term
success of our Company.
John Burkart has been appointed Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer after previously serving as Executive Vice
President  Chief Operating Officer. Prior to joining Welltower in 2021, Mr. Burkart spent 25 years at Essex Property Trust (NYSE: ESS), a

level employee experience through the modernization and digital transformation of the business. Mr. Burkart has also sustained the Companys track record of delivering industry-leading operating results through a range of asset management

appointment as CIO, Mr. Chaudhri has overseen approximately $11 billion of global capital deployment across all property types and up and down the capital stack. Mr. Chaudhuri also leads our industry-leading talent recruitment,
training and development, and management program. Mr. Chaudhri holds an MBA from Columbia Business School and a BSE in computer science engineering from the University of Michigan and is a CFA charterholder.

and our journey is just getting started. Our world-class team is
all-in
and we continuously seek to optimize growth within our existing businesses, evaluate new ventures and business opportunities, and pursue
investments with superior returns, lower risk, and long duration.
As one of the most prolific investors in the aging demographic trend that is unfolding in the macrocosm of
our society across the US, UK, and Canada, we are also acutely aware of the current and upcoming wave of retirements within leadership positions across preeminent public and private real estate institutions, a microcosm of this broader demographic
trend. Welltower prides itself on recruiting, nurturing, and developing
top-tier
talent, allowing our team members to attain a wide-range of experience and great track records, making them among the most
sought-after leaders within the real estate sector.
Through todays promotions, we are not only recognizing and retaining our most valued team
members, but also taking the first step of creating significant opportunities for growth and advancement of the next generation of leadership at Welltower beyond the current executive team. While we remain extraordinarily excited about our growth
prospects in the coming years, we are also committed to ensuring the Companys continued success decades from now.
