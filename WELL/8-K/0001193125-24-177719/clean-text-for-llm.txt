Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
Notes Offering
On July 11, 2024, Welltower OP LLC (the “Issuer”), the operating company through which Welltower Inc. (the “Company”) conducts all of its business, issued $[900] [1,035],000,000 principal amount of its 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”) [, which amount includes $135,000,000 principal amount of the Notes pursuant to the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to acquire additional Notes]. The Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an Indenture, dated as of July 11, 2024 (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes were sold in the United States only to accredited investors pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and subsequently resold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
The Notes are the Issuer’s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, equal in right of payment to the Issuer’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, effectively junior to any of the Issuer’s future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) and preferred equity of the Issuer’s subsidiaries. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company on a senior unsecured basis.
The Notes will pay interest semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025, at a rate of 3.125% per year. The Notes will mature on July 15, 2029 (the “Maturity Date”), unless earlier exchanged, purchased or redeemed.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding July 20, 2027, the Notes are exchangeable at the option of holders only upon certain circumstances and during certain periods. On or after July 20, 2027, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the Maturity Date. The Issuer will settle exchanges of Notes by delivering cash up to the principal amount of the Notes exchanged and, in respect of the remainder of the exchange value, if any, in excess thereof, cash or shares, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”), or a combination thereof, at the election of the Issuer. The exchange rate initially equals 7.8177 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $127.91 per share of Common Stock and an exchange premium of approximately 22.5% based on the closing price of $104.42 per share of Common Stock on July 8, 2024). The exchange rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.
If a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur or if the Issuer provides notice of redemption, the Issuer may be required, in certain circumstances, to increase the exchange rate for any Notes exchanged in connection with such fundamental change or notice of redemption.
The Issuer may redeem the Notes, at its option, in whole or in part, on any business day on or after July 20, 2027, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock has been at least 130% of the exchange price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Issuer provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) other than those described in the following sentence occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare 100% of the principal of,
2
and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all then outstanding Notes to be due and payable. In the case of an Event of Default arising out of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events (as set forth in the Indenture), 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will automatically become due and payable.
The Issuer intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or redemption of debt (which may include the 4.000% Notes due June 1, 2025) and investment in health care, wellness and seniors housing properties. Pending such use, the net proceeds may be invested in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities, certificates of deposit or indirect or guaranteed obligations of the United States.
The foregoing description of the Indenture and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the form of global note, filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference herein.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, on July 11, 2024, the Issuer and the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the initial purchasers of the Notes.
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed that it will:
•
on or before the 90th day after the original issuance of the Notes, file a shelf registration statement (which will be an automatic shelf registration statement if the Company is then a well-known seasoned issuer (“WKSI”)) or a resale prospectus supplement to an effective shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) providing for the registration of, and the sale on a continuous delayed basis by the holders of the Common Stock, if any, issuable upon exchange of the Notes;
•
if the Company is not a WKSI on such 90th day, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shelf registration statement or resale prospectus supplement to become effective within 180 days after the first date of original issuance of the Notes; and
•
use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement or resale prospectus effective until the earlier of (1) the 30th trading day immediately following the Maturity Date (subject to extension for any suspension of the effectiveness of the registration during such
30-trading
day period immediately following the Maturity Date) and (2) the date on which there are no longer outstanding any Notes or shares of Common Stock issued upon exchange thereof that would be “restricted” securities (within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act).
If the Issuer does not fulfill certain of its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement with respect to the Notes, the Issuer will be required to pay additional interest to holders of the Notes. If a holder of the Notes exchanges some or all of its Notes, such holder will not be entitled to additional interest. However, if such holder exchanges its Notes when there exists a registration default with respect to shares of Common Stock, the Issuer will increase the applicable exchange rate by 3% instead of paying any additional interest.
The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Registration Rights Agreement, filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Initially, a maximum of [8,619,030][9,911,884] shares of Common Stock may be issued upon exchange of the Notes, based on the initial maximum exchange rate of 9.5767 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is subject to customary adjustments.

Exhibit 99.1
Welltower Announces
Closing of $1.035 Billion of
Exchangeable Senior Notes
TOLEDO, Ohio,
July 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/  Welltower
®
Inc. (NYSE: WELL) (Welltower or the Company) announced today that its operating company, Welltower OP LLC
(Welltower OP), has closed the previously announced offering (the Offering) of $1.035 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.125% exchangeable senior notes due 2029 in a private placement to persons reasonably believed
to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). The aggregate principal amount of notes issued reflects the exercise in full of the initial
purchasers option to purchase additional notes.
The notes are Welltower OPs senior unsecured obligations and will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on
January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025, at a rate of 3.125% per year. The notes will mature on July 15, 2029 (the Maturity Date), unless earlier exchanged, purchased or redeemed. The
Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes on a senior unsecured basis.
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding January 15, 2029, the notes are exchangeable at the option of holders only upon certain circumstances and during certain periods. On or after January 15, 2029, the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders at any
time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the Maturity Date. Welltower OP will settle exchanges of the notes by delivering cash up to the principal amount of the notes exchanged and, in respect of the
remainder of the exchange value, if any, in excess thereof, cash or shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the Common Stock), or a combination thereof, at the election of Welltower OP. The exchange rate
initially equals 7.8177 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $127.91 per share of Common Stock and an exchange premium of approximately 22.5% based on the closing price of
$104.42 per share of Common Stock on July 8, 2024). The exchange rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.
If a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that governs the notes) occurs, subject to certain conditions, holders of the notes may require Welltower
OP to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date (as
defined in the indenture that will govern the notes). In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur, Welltower OP may be required, in certain circumstances, to increase the exchange rate for any notes in connection with such fundamental changes
by a specified number of shares of its common stock.
Welltower OP may redeem the notes, at its option, in whole or in part, on any business day on or after
July 20, 2027, if the last reported sale price of the Common Stock has been at least 130% of the exchange price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and
including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Welltower OP provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the redemption date.
Welltower OP intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include
the repayment or redemption of debt (which may include the 4.000% Notes due June 1, 2025) and investment in health care, wellness and seniors housing properties. Pending such use, the net proceeds may be invested in short-term, investment
grade, interest-bearing securities, certificates of deposit or indirect or guaranteed obligations of the United States.
Neither the notes nor the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exchange of the notes have been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. Accordingly, the notes have been offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional
buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act).
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy,
nor shall there be any offer or sale of, the notes in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale of the notes would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or
jurisdiction.
