Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 24, 2024, Welltower Inc. (the “Company”) entered into Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement” which Amended Credit Agreement amends the Company’s existing Credit Agreement dated as of June 4, 2021 as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time) with a consortium of 29 banks; KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent and L/C issuer; BofA Securities, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities LLC, as joint book runners; BofA Securities, as book runner; BofA Securities, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities LLC, as U.S. joint lead arrangers; BofA Securities, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and RBC Capital Markets, as Canadian joint lead arrangers; Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities LLC as co-syndication agents; Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent; MUFG Bank, Ltd., Barclays Bank PLC, Citibank, N.A., Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., PNC Bank, National Association and Royal Bank of Canada, as co-documentation agents; BNP Paribas, Citizens Bank, N.A., Fifth Third Bank, National Association, The Huntington National Bank, Regions Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, New York Branch, TD Bank, NA, Truist Bank, The Bank of New York Mellon, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., New York Branch and Bank of Montreal, as co-senior managing agents, Capital One, National Association, as managing agent and Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, as sustainability structuring agent.  The Amended Credit Agreement consists of a
$5,000,000,000
unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), comprised of a
$3,000,000,000
tranche (the “Revolving A Tranche”) and a
$2,000,000,000
tranche (the “Revolving B Tranche”), a $
1,000,000,000
unsecured term loan facility that was originally issued under the Prior Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the “USD Term Facility”) and a CAD
250,000,000
unsecured term loan facility that was originally issued under the Prior Credit Agreement (the “CAD Term Facility”), and replaces the Company’s existing $
4,000,000,000
unsecured revolving credit facility, $500,000,000 unsecured term loan facility and CAD
250,000,000
unsecured term loan facility.
The maturity date for the Revolving A Tranche is July 24, 2028, the maturity date for the Revolving B Tranche is July 24, 2029 and the maturity date for each of the USD Term Facility and the CAD Term Facility is July 19, 2026; provided, that, the maturity date of the Revolving A Tranche, the Revolving B Tranche, the USD Term Facility and/or the CAD Term Facility may be extended for two successive terms of six months each if no event of default has occurred under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Company pays a non-refundable extension fee of 0.0625% of the applicable tranche then in effect. Based on the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company has the right to increase the amount available under the credit facilities up to an additional
$1,250,000,000
for the Revolving Facility and the USD Term Facility, in the aggregate, and CAD
250,000,000
for the CAD Term Facility. The lenders would have the right, but not the obligation, to commit to all or a portion of any such increase.
The Amended Credit Agreement includes sublimits of (a) up to $100,000,000 for letters of credit, (b) up to 50% of the Revolving Facility commitment amount for certain negotiated rate loans, and (c) up to $1,000,000,000 for borrowings (including letters of credit) under certain alternative currencies; each of these sublimits are part of, and not in addition to, the amounts available under the Revolving Facility.
Revolving loans and term loans bear interest at the applicable margin plus the base rate or applicable SOFR/CORRA interest rate, at the Company’s option. Negotiated rate loans bear interest at the rate agreed to between the Company and the applicable lender(s). Letter of credit fees equal the applicable margin for revolving loans multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under such letters of credit. The applicable margins are based on the Company’s ratings established by certain debt rating agencies for the Company’s long term, senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt (the “Debt Ratings”).
For the Revolving Facility, the Company is obligated to pay an annual facility fee equal to the product of the applicable rate multiplied by the Revolving Facility amount with such rate based on the Company’s Debt Ratings. In addition to Debt Ratings, further reductions of the interest rate and annual facility fee can be achieved based on compliance with a leverage ratio.
Achieving certain sustainability metrics shall result in a 1.0 basis point reduction in the applicable rate for all loans.
The Amended Credit Agreement includes certain customary representations and warranties by the Company and imposes certain customary covenants on the Company. The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, and if an event of default occurs and continues, the Company is subject to certain actions by the administrative agent, including, without limitation, the acceleration of repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.
Certain of the parties to the Amended Credit Agreement and/or their affiliates have provided and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial banking and/or advisory services to the Company for which they receive customary fees and expenses.
The foregoing description does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties thereto. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Amended Credit Agreement are not necessarily characterizations of the actual state of facts of the Company and its subsidiaries at the time they were made or otherwise and should be read only in conjunction with the other information that the Company makes publicly available in reports, statements and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries of, and should not rely upon, such representations, warranties and covenants.

Notable Portfolio Activity
In the second quarter, we completed $1.7 billion of pro rata gross investments, including $1.4 billion in acquisitions and loan funding and $251 million in development funding. We opened 13 development projects, including partial conversions and expansions, for an aggregate pro rata investment amount of $214 million. Additionally, during the second quarter we completed pro rata property dispositions and loan repayments of $578 million.
Private Equity Acquisition and Loan Funding
During the second quarter, we acquired a portfolio of seniors housing communities for $271 million and provided a first mortgage loan collateralized by a portfolio of seniors housing properties for $456 million. The portfolios comprise 12 high quality seniors housing communities encompassing approximately 2,000 units.
Atria Senior Living
As previously announced, we entered into an agreement to transition 89 Holiday by Atria communities to six of Welltower's existing operating partners with strong operating acumen and deep expertise in their respective regions. To date, operations for 69 properties have been transitioned to new operators, with the remaining properties expected to be transitioned by the end of the third quarter.
Triple-net to Seniors Housing Operating Transitions
During the second quarter, we reached agreements to convert 47 triple-net leased properties to Seniors Housing Operating (RIDEA) structures, allowing us to directly participate in the underlying cash flow growth of the communities. The transition to highly-aligned RIDEA 4.0 structures will deepen our partnership with several leading managers, build on success within their existing portfolios, and ensure that both Welltower and our partners benefit from the communities' future growth potential. We completed 11 of these transitions during the second quarter and expect to complete the remainder during the third quarter.
Announced Future Investment Activity

During the second quarter, we achieved an MSCI ESG rating of "AA", reflecting our robust corporate governance practices, ESG risk management relative to peers and ongoing commitment to advancing sustainability initiatives. Additionally, in June, we released our 2023 ESG Report, which is available on our website, summarizing our progress and achievements across a range of ESG initiatives, including those related to diversity and inclusion, environmental responsibility and corporate governance.
Dividend
On
July 29, 2024
, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 of $0.67 per share, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. This dividend
, which will be paid on August 21, 2024 to stockholders of record as of August 12, 2024, will be our
213th
consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends remains subject to review an
d approval by the Board of Directors.
Outlook for 2024
Net income attributable to common stockholders guidance has been revised to a range of $1.52 to $1.60 per diluted share from the previous range of $1.45 to $1.57 per diluted share. We increased the guidance range of full year normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders to a range of $4.13 to $4.21 per diluted share from the previous range of $4.05 to $4.17 per diluted share. In preparing our guidance, we have updated or confirmed the following assumptions:
•
Same Store NOI: We expect average blended SSNOI growth of 10.0% to 12.5%, which is comprised of the following components:
◦
Seniors Housing Operating approximately 19.0% to 23.0%
◦
Seniors Housing Triple-net approximately 3.0% to 4.0%
◦
Outpatient Medical approximately 2.0% to 3.0%
◦
Long-Term/Post-Acute Care approximately 2.0% to 3.0%
•
Investments: Our earnings guidance includes only those acquisitions announced or closed to date. Furthermore, no transitions or restructures beyond those announced to date are included.
•
General and Administrative Expenses: We anticipate general and administrative expenses to be approximately $205 million to $211 million and stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $40 million.
•
Development: We anticipate funding an additional $328 million of development in 2024 relating to projects underway as of June 30, 2024.
•
Dispositions: We expect pro rata disposition proceeds of $643 million at a blended yield of 6.9% in the next twelve months. This includes approximately $601 million of consideration from expected property sales and $42 millio
n of expected proceeds from loan repayments.
•
Pandemic Relief Funds: Our initial 2024 earnings guidance did not include the recognition of any pandemic relief funds which may be received during the year. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized approximately $2
million
Page 2 of 11
2Q24
Earnings Release
July 29, 2024
at our share related to Provider Relief Funds and similar programs in the United Kingdom and Canada. Our updated guidance does not include any additional funds in 2024. In 2023, we recognized approximately $13 million at our share relating to Provider Relief Funds and similar programs in the United Kingdom and Canada.
Our guidance does not include any additional investments, dispositions or capital transactions beyond those we have announced, nor any other expenses, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional normalizing items. Please see the Supplemental Reporting Measures section for further discussion and our definition of normalized FFO and SSNOI and Exhibit 3 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders. We will provide additional detail regarding our
2024
outlook and assumptions on the
second
quarter
2024
conference call.
Conference Call Information

Supplemental Reporting Measures
We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders ("NICS"), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider funds from operations ("FFO"), normalized FFO, net operating income ("NOI"), same store NOI ("SSNOI"), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Excluding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis. Pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners’ noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts. We do not control unconsolidated investments. While we consider pro rata disclosures useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution.
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO attributable to common stockholders, as defined by NAREIT, means net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 2. We believe that normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of Welltower between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.
We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to managers, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. SSNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in the same store amounts five full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service. Land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the period, are excluded from the same store amounts. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the redevelopment. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the operator transition or segment transition. In addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from same store amounts until five full quarters after the properties are placed back into service. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes adjustments to present consistent property ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and UK properties using a consistent exchange rate. Normalizers include adjustments that in management’s opinion are appropriate in considering SSNOI, a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure. None of these adjustments, which may increase or decrease SSNOI, are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant normalizers (defined as any that individually exceed 0.50% of SSNOI growth per property type) are separately disclosed and explained. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful
Page 3 of 11
2Q24
Earnings Release
July 29, 2024
information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties. No reconciliation of the forecasted range for SSNOI on a combined basis or by property type is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors.
We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The ratios are based on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income per income statement) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/losses/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments deemed appropriate in management's opinion. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. Our leverage ratios include net debt to Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated enterprise value. Net debt is defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
Consolidated enterprise value represents the sum of net debt, the fair market value of our common stock and noncontrolling interests.
Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which is available on Welltower's website (www.welltower.com), for information and reconciliations of additional supplemental reporting measures.

Notes:
(1) Represents principal amounts due excluding unamortized premiums/discounts or other fair value adjustments as reflected on the balance sheet.
(2) Our unsecured commercial paper program and our unsecured revolving credit facility had a zero balance as of June 30, 2024. The unsecured revolving credit facility is comprised of a $1,000,000,000 tranche that matures on June 4, 2026 and a $3,000,000,000 tranche that matures on June 4, 2025. Both tranches may be extended for two successive terms of six months at our option. Commercial paper borrowings are backstopped by the unsecured revolving credit facility.
(3) 2027 includes a $1,000,000,000 unsecured term loan and a CAD $250,000,000 unsecured term loan (approximately $182,695,000 USD at June 30, 2024). The loans mature on July 19, 2026. The interest rates on the loans are adjusted SOFR + 0.85% for USD and adjusted CORRA + 0.85% for CAD. Both term loans may be extended for two successive terms of six months at our option.
(4) 2027 includes CAD $300,000,000 of 2.95% senior unsecured notes (approximately $219,234,000 USD at June 30, 2024) that matures on January 15, 2027.
(5) 2028 includes $1,035,000,000 of 2.75% exchangeable senior unsecured notes that mature on May 15, 2028 unless earlier exchanged, purchased or redeemed.
(6) 2028 includes £550,000,000 of 4.80% senior unsecured notes (approximately $695,200,000 USD at June 30, 2024). The notes mature on November 20, 2028.
(7) Thereafter includes £500,000,000 of 4.50% senior unsecured notes (approximately $632,000,000 USD at June 30, 2024). The notes mature on December 1, 2034.
(8) Excludes operating lease liabilities of $302,309,000 and finance lease liabilities of $91,361,000 related to ASC 842.
(9) Based on variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of June 30, 2024. The interest rate on the unsecured revolving credit facility is adjusted SOFR + 0.775%. Commercial paper, senior notes and secured debt average interest rate represents the face value note rate. Includes the impact of notional swaps and caps to convert fixed rate debt to SOFR-based floating rate debt, and SOFR-based floating rate debt and CORRA-based floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
(10) Represents notional value of foreign currency derivative contracts at end of period spot FX rates. The fair market value of the gains (losses) of these contracts is currently USD $35,763,000, as represented in other assets (liabilities) on the balance sheet. We supplement our local currency debt with foreign currency derivative contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our international investments. Currently, our foreign currency derivatives are comprised of cross-currency swaps.

Glossary
Age:
Current year, less the year built, adjusted for major renovations. Average age is weighted by pro rata NOI.
Cap-ex, Tenant Improvements, Leasing Commissions:
Represents amounts incurred for: 1) recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties; 2) second generation tenant improvements; and 3) leasing commissions paid to third party leasing agents to secure new tenants.
Construction Conversion:
Represents completed construction projects that were placed into service and began generating NOI.
EBITDAR:
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate EBITDAR and has not independently verified the information.
EBITDAR Coverage:
Represents the ratio of EBITDAR to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. EBITDAR coverage is a measure of a property’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations. The coverage shown excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed or for which data is not available or meaningful.
EBITDARM:
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate EBITDARM and has not independently verified the information.
EBITDARM Coverage:
Represents the ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans.  EBITDARM coverage is a measure of a property’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations, assuming that management fees are not paid. The coverage shown excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed or for which data is not available or meaningful.
Health System - Affiliated:
Outpatient medical properties are considered affiliated with a health system if one or more of the following conditions are met:  1) the land parcel is contained within the physical boundaries of a hospital campus; 2) the land parcel is located adjacent to the campus; 3) the building is physically connected to the hospital regardless of the land ownership structure; 4) a ground lease is maintained with a health system entity; 5) a master lease is maintained with a health system entity; 6) significant square footage is leased to a health system entity; 7) the property includes an ambulatory surgery center with a hospital partnership interest; or (8) a significant square footage is leased to a physician group that is either employed, directly or indirectly by a health system, or has a significant clinical and financial affiliation with the health system.
Long-Term/Post-Acute Care:
Includes all skilled nursing, rehabilitation and long-term/post-acute care facilities where the majority of individuals require 24-hour nursing or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement and are subject to triple-net operating leases. Most of these facilities focus on higher acuity patients and offer rehabilitation units specializing in cardiac, orthopedic, dialysis, neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation.
MSA:
For the United States and Canada, we use the Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Census Metropolitan Areas as defined by Statistics Canada, respectively. For the United Kingdom, we generally use the Metro Region as defined by EuroStat with Greater London defined as a 55-mile radius around the city’s center.
Occupancy:
Outpatient Medical occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported. Occupancy for all other property types represents average quarterly operating occupancy based on the most recent quarter of available data and excludes properties that are unstabilized, closed or for which data is not available or meaningful. The company uses unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants/borrowers to calculate occupancy and has not independently verified the information. Occupancy metrics are reflected at our pro rata share.
Outpatient Medical:
Outpatient medical buildings include properties offering ambulatory medical services such as prima
ry and secondary care, outpatient surgery, diagnostic procedures and rehabilitation. These properties are typically affiliated with a health system and may be located on a hospital campus.  They are specifically designed and constructed for use by health care professionals to provide services to patients. They also include medical office buildings that typically contain sole and group physician practices and may provide laboratory and other specialty services.
Seniors Housing Operating (SHO):
Includes independent, assisted living and dementia care properties in the U.S. and Canada and all care homes in the U.K. generally structured to take advantage of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, as well as Wellness Housing properties.
Seniors Housing Triple-net (SH-NNN):
Includes independent, assisted living and dementia care properties in the U.S. and Canada and all care homes in the U.K. subject to triple-net operating leases and loans receivable.
Square Feet
:
Net rentable square feet calculated utilizing Building Owners and Managers Association measurement standards.
Stable:
Generally, a triple-net rental property is considered stable (versus unstabilized or under development) when it has achieved EBITDAR coverage of 1.00x or greater for three consecutive months or, if targeted performance has not been achieved, 12 months following the budgeted stabilization date. Triple-net properties for which income is recognized on a cash basis and for which substantially all contractual rent during the period has not been collected are excluded from the stable portfolio. A Seniors Housing Operating facility is considered stable upon the earliest of 90% occupancy, NOI at or above the underwritten target or 12 months past the underwritten stabilization date. Excludes assets held for sale and assets disposed of during the current quarter.
Unstabilized:
An acquisition that does not meet the stable criteria upon closing or a construction property that has opened but not yet reached stabilization.

Supplemental Reporting Measures
We believe that revenues and net income, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, RevPOR, ExpPOR, SS RevPOR, SS ExpPOR, NOI, In-Place NOI ("IPNOI") and Same Store NOI ("SSNOI") to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Excluding EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis. Pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners’ noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts. We do not control unconsolidated investments. While we consider pro rata disclosures useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution.
We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to managers, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and are unallocable to the properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. IPNOI represents NOI excluding interest income, other income and non-IPNOI and adjusted for timing of current quarter portfolio changes such as acquisitions, development conversions, segment transitions, dispositions and investments held for sale. SSNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in the same store amounts five full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service. Land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the period, are excluded from the same store amounts. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the redevelopment. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the operator transition or segment transition. In addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from same store amounts until five full quarters after the properties are placed back into service. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes adjustments to present consistent property ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and UK properties using a consistent exchange rate. Normalizers include adjustments that in management’s opinion are appropriate in considering SSNOI, a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure. None of these adjustments, which may increase or decrease SSNOI, are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant normalizers (defined as any that individually exceed 0.50% of SSNOI growth per property type) are separately disclosed and explained. We believe NOI, IPNOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI, IPNOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.
RevPOR represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month and ExpPOR represents the average expenses per occupied room at our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These metrics are calculated as our pro rata version of total resident fees and services revenues or property operating expenses from the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days. SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR are used to evaluate the RevPOR and ExpPOR performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio. They are based on the same pool of properties used for SSNOI and includes any revenue or expense normalizations used for SSNOI. We use RevPOR, ExpPOR, SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR to evaluate the revenue-generating capacity and profit potential of our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates. They are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics, if known, to evaluate the quality of our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio.
We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. We
expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The ratios are based on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income per income statement) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/losses/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments deemed appropriate in management's opinion. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest and secured debt principal amortization. Our leverage ratios include net debt to Adjusted EBITDA, book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and consolidated enterprise value. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Consolidated enterprise value represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization.
Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of the supplemental reporting measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Multi-period amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts due to rounding.
