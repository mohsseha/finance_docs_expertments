As discussed under Item 5.07 of this Current Report on Form
8-K,
at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 23, 2024 (the “Annual Meeting”), shareholders of Welltower Inc. (the “Company”) approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) to (i) limit the liability of certain officers as permitted by Delaware law and (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock, $1.00 par value per share, from 700,000,000 shares to 1,400,000,000 shares. The amendment to the Charter became effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Amendment of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the “Certificate of Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the “Secretary of State”) on May 23, 2024. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) also approved a Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Restated Charter”), that restated and integrated, but did not further amend, the Charter (as amended through the filing of the Certificate of Amendment). On May 23, 2024, the Company filed the Restated Charter with the Secretary of State, and it was effective upon filing. The foregoing summaries of the Certificate of Amendment and Restated Charter are qualified in all respects by reference to the text of the Certificate of Amendment and the Restated Charter, respectively, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form
