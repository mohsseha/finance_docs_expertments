The Notes were sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2025, among the Company, the Guarantor and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, BofA Securities, Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters.
The Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated as of March 15, 2010 (the “Indenture”), as amended by Supplemental Indenture No. 23, dated as of April 1, 2022 (“Supplemental Indenture No. 23”), among the Company, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”), each of which was incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 24, dated as of June 27, 2025 (“Supplemental Indenture No. 24”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Supplemental Indenture No. 24,
