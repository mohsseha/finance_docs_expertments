Exhibit 99.1 Business Update January 22, 2024
Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors This document contains
“forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When Welltower uses words such as “may,” “will,” “intend,” “should,” “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “pro forma,” “estimate” or similar expressions that do not relate solely to historical matters, Welltower is making forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements, including statements related to the anticipated transactions involving certain ProMedica assets and Funds From Operations guidance, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that may
cause Welltower’s actual results to differ materially from Welltower’s expectations discussed in the forward-looking statements. This may be a result of various factors, including, but not limited to: the status of the economy; the
status of capital markets, including availability and cost of capital; issues facing the health care industry, including compliance with, and changes to, regulations and payment policies, responding to government investigations and punitive
settlements and operators’/tenants’ difficulty in cost effectively obtaining and maintaining adequate liability and other insurance; changes in financing terms; competition within the health care and seniors housing industries; negative
developments in the operating results or financial condition of operators/tenants, including, but not limited to, their ability to pay rent and repay loans; Welltower’s ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results; the
failure to make new investments or acquisitions as and when anticipated; natural disasters, health emergencies (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and other acts of God affecting Welltower’s properties; Welltower’s ability to re-lease space
at similar rates as vacancies occur; Welltower’s ability to timely reinvest sale proceeds at similar rates to assets sold; operator/tenant or joint venture partner bankruptcies or insolvencies; the cooperation of joint venture partners;
government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational requirements; liability or contract claims by or against operators/tenants; unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to future investments or
acquisitions; environmental laws affecting Welltower’s properties; changes in rules or practices governing Welltower’s financial reporting; the movement of U.S. and foreign currency exchange rates; Welltower’s ability to maintain
its qualification as a REIT; key management personnel recruitment and retention; and other risks described in Welltower’s reports filed from time to time with the SEC. Welltower undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements. 2
Recent Highlights (1) Expect full year 2023 net income attributable to
common stockholders below previously issued guidance range of $0.91 - $0.95 per diluted share • Primarily driven by a delay in asset disposition timing from 4Q2023 to early 2024, which resulted in a lower-than-expected gain on sale during the
period, and certain expenses tied to transaction activity in the fourth quarter Anticipate full year 2023 normalized funds from operations (FFO) at the high end of previously issued guidance range of $3.59 - $3.63 per diluted share Seniors Housing
Operating (SHO) Portfolio Update • SS Revenue: Expect to achieve full year 2023 same store (SS) year-over-year revenue growth in-line with previously issued guidance of 9.8% • 4Q2023 year-over-year occupancy growth meaningfully
outperformed historical seasonality, representing the strongest quarterly growth of the year • As previously disclosed, 4Q2023 reported RevPOR growth decelerated relative to 3Q2023 given base-year impact of a one-time pull forward of a large
operator’s in-place rent increases to 4Q2022. The operator is expected to resume its historical cadence of January in-place rent increases in 2024 • Welltower’s asset management initiatives and a further improvement in
demand/supply conditions continue to result in favorable trends across all geographies • SS ExpPOR growth continued to decelerate in 4Q2023 following a further normalization of labor market conditions and continued abatement of broader
inflationary pressures • Expect year-over-year SS NOI growth to approximate the midpoint of previously issued guidance of 23% - 26% Capital Deployment Update (2) • Completed pro rata gross investments of $2.8 billion in 4Q2023 and $4.8
billion during the full year 2023. 2H2023 represented one of the most active periods of capital deployment in WELL’s history • ~$1.2 billion of under contract acquisition activity expected to close in 1H2024 with closing dates driven by
loan assumption timing • Building on the pace of investment activity into year end, the pipeline remains robust and is comprised of off-market, privately negotiated, and granular transactions. Investments expected to be completed at an
attractive basis and in-place yield, with meaningful future cash flow upside, resulting in compelling unlevered IRRs • Acquisitions expected to drive meaningful per share value for existing shareholders given attractive basis, operational
upside, and significant and irreplicable value-add from WELL’s operating platform • Capital deployment environment remains attractive as motivated sellers seek near-term liquidity and operator solutions Balance Sheet Update • As
previously disclosed, raised $1.7 billion of proceeds via an equity offering announced on November 6, 2023, including full exercise of the green shoe • Announced acquisition activity to be fully equity funded through cash on hand with
sufficient cash on hand to also to address 2024 debt maturities 3 1. See Supplemental Financial Measures at the end of this presentation for reconciliations and Welltower’s 3Q2023 Earnings Release dated October 30, 2023 2. Excluding

Supplemental Financial Measures 20
Non-GAAP Financial Measures We believe that revenues, net income and
net income attributable to common stockholders ( NICS ), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider Funds from Operations ( FFO ), Normalized FFO,
Net Operating Income ( NOI ), In-Place NOI ( IPNOI ), Same Store NOI ( SSNOI ), RevPOR, ExpPOR, Same Store RevPOR ( SS RevPOR ) and Same Store ExpPOR ( SS ExpPOR ) to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. These supplemental
measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis. Pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners’ noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts.
We do not control unconsolidated investments. While we consider pro rata disclosures useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. Our supplemental
reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Our management uses these
financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of the
supplemental reporting measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the
supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Multi-period amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts
due to rounding. 21
FFO and Normalized FFO Historical cost accounting for real estate
assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with
market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO attributable to common stockholders, as defined by NAREIT, means net income
attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in the reconciliations and described in our earnings press releases for the relevant periods.
We believe that Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare our operating performance between periods or to other
REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items. 22

Based on expected year-end results, we now anticipate approximately $80 million less in gains on real estate dispositions, net of impairments, as a result of timing delays from dispositions previously expected to close in 4Q23 which are excluded
from the table above. (4) See our 3Q23 earnings press release for more information. (5) Based on expected year-end results, we now anticipate approximately $25 million of additional expenses in connection with fourth quarter transaction activity
primarily related to the Retirement Unlimited Inc. (RUI) and Brandywine Living merger which are excluded from the table above. 23
NOI, IPNOI, SSNOI, RevPOR, ExpPOR, SS RevPOR & SS ExpPOR We define
NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not
limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general
overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation
of corporate fixed assets. IPNOI represents NOI excluding interest income, other income and non-IPNOI and adjusted for timing of current quarter portfolio changes such as acquisitions, development conversions, segment transitions, dispositions and
investments held for sale. SSNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those
revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in the same store amounts five full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service. Land
parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the period, are excluded from the same store amounts. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property
where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the
redevelopment. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the operator transition or segment transition. In addition, properties
significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from same store amounts until five full quarters after the properties are placed back into service. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes
adjustments to present consistent property ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and UK properties using a consistent exchange rate. Normalizers include adjustments that in management’s opinion are appropriate in
considering SSNOI, a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure. None of these adjustments, which may increase or decrease SSNOI, are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant normalizers (defined as
any that individually exceed 0.50% of SSNOI growth per property type) are separately disclosed and explained in the relevant supplemental reporting package. We believe NOI, IPNOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because
they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI, IPNOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties. RevPOR
represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at our Seniors Housing Operating properties and ExpPOR represents the average expenses per occupied room per month at our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These metrics are
calculated as the pro rata version of resident fees and services revenues or property operating expenses per the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days. SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR are used to evaluate the RevPOR and ExpPOR
performance of our properties under a consistent population, which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio. They are based on the same pool of properties used for SSNOI and includes any revenue or expense normalizations used for
SSNOI. We use RevPOR, ExpPOR, SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR to evaluate the revenue-generating capacity and profit potential of our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates. They are also used in comparison against
industry and competitor statistics, if known, to evaluate the quality of our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio. 24
