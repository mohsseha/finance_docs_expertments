| Consolidation Policy Text Block | Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. At inception of transactions, we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) substantially all of an entity's activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights, (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support or (iii) the equity investors as a group lack any of the following: (a) the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, (b) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or (c) the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity. Criterion (iii) is generally applied to limited partnerships and similarly structured entities by assessing whether a simple majority of the limited partners hold substantive rights to participate in significant decisions of the entity or have the ability to remove the decision maker or liquidate the entity without cause. If neither of those criteria are met, the entity is a VIE.We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidations (“ASC 810”), requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated. This evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance and the rights held by limited partners or non-managing members.The designation of an entity as a VIE is reassessed upon certain events, including but not limited to: (i) a change to the contractual arrangements of the entity or in the ability of a party to exercise its participation or kick-out rights, (ii) a change to the capitalization structure of the entity or (iii) acquisitions or sales of interests that constitute a change in control. | c-1 |  |

| Deferred Loan Expenses Policy Text Block | Deferred Loan ExpensesDeferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection with the issuance, assumption and amendments of debt arrangements. Deferred loan expenses related to debt instruments, excluding the primary unsecured credit facility, are recorded as a reduction of the related debt liability. Deferred loan expenses related to the primary unsecured credit facility are included in receivables and other assets. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. | c-1 |  |

| Earnings Per Share Policy Text Block | Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period, adjusted for non-vested shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. Additionally, net income (loss) allocated to OP Units and DownREIT Units (discussed above) has been included in the numerator and redeemable common stock related to the OP Units and DownREIT Units have been included in the denominator for the purpose of computing diluted earnings per share. | c-1 |  |

| Equity Method Investments Disclosure Text Block | Investments in Unconsolidated Entities | c-1 |  |
| Equity Method Investments Policy | Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesInvestments in entities that we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the equity interest inclusive of transaction costs. To the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level, the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity. For earnings of equity method investments with pro rata distribution allocations, net income or loss is allocated between the partners in the joint venture based upon their respective stated ownership. In other instances, net income or loss may be allocated between the partners in the joint venture based on the hypothetical liquidation at book value method ("HLBV method"). Under the HLBV method, we recognize income and loss in each period based on the change in liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of the underlying investment at book value. | c-1 |  |

| Income Tax Policy Text Block | Federal Income TaxWe have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the IRC, commencing with our first taxable year, and made no provision for U.S. federal income tax purposes prior to our acquisition of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). As a result of these, as well as subsequent acquisitions, we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities that are taxed as TRSs under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions. We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. See Note 19 for additional information. | c-1 |  |

| Loan Receivable Policy Policy Text Block | In Substance Real Estate InvestmentsWe provide loans to third parties for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under these arrangements, it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or acquisition of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. Arrangements with characteristics implying loan classification are presented as real estate loans receivable and result in the recognition of interest income. Arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments and presented as investments in unconsolidated entities and are accounted for using the equity method. The classification of each arrangement as either a real estate loan receivable or investment in unconsolidated entity involves judgment and relies on various factors, including market conditions, amount and timing of expected residual profits, credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, estimated fair value of the collateral, and significance of borrower equity in the project, among others. The classification of such arrangements is performed at inception, and periodically reassessed when significant changes occur in the circumstances or conditions described above. | c-1 |  |

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | New Accounting Standards•In March 2020, the FASB issued an amendment to the reference rate reform standard, which provides the option for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on contract modifications and hedge accounting. An example of such reform is the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. Entities that make this optional expedient election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess the accounting treatment if certain criteria are met and would continue applying hedge accounting for relationships affected by reference rate reform. In December 2022, the FASB extended the date for which this guidance can be applied from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. We continue to monitor developments related to the LIBOR transition and identification of an alternative, market-accepted rate.•In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures," which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.•In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09")," which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. | c-1 |  |

| Real Estate Investment Financial Statements Disclosure Text Block | The following is a summary of our investments in unconsolidated entities (dollars in thousands): | c-1 |  |
| Real Estate Policy Text Block | Real Property OwnedReal estate acquisitions are generally classified as asset acquisitions for which we record tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities at cost on a relative fair value basis. Liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. Tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings and improvements. In making estimates of relative fair value, we utilize a number of sources including independent appraisals, our own analysis of recently acquired or developed and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data.Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities consist primarily of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value associated with the presence of in-place leases. The value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in acquired lease intangibles and below market leases are included in other liabilities on the balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values for in-place tenants based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant. Characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values for in-place residents with such value representing (i) value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs that would be incurred in an assumed re-leasing period, and (ii) value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during an assumed re-leasing period. This intangible asset is amortized over the remaining life of the lease or the assumed re-leasing period.Real property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of construction period interest. Owned properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from15to40years for buildings and5to15years for improvements. We consider costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including tenant improvements and lease commissions, to represent the acquisition of productive assets and, accordingly, such costs are reflected as investment activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The net book value of real property owned is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that a property may be impaired. This evaluation of indicators of impairment of a property is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the property or a change in management's intent to hold and operate the property. If an indicator of impairment of the property is identified, management estimates whether the carrying value is recoverable using observable and unobservable inputs such as historical and forecasted cash flows and estimated capitalization rates. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of the property will not be recoverable, the carrying value of the property is reduced to the estimated fair market value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Additionally, properties that meet the held for sale criteria are recorded at the lesser of fair value less costs to sell or the carrying value. | c-1 |  |

| Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Policy Text Block | Welltower OP Noncontrolling InterestsMembers of Welltower OP other than Welltower have the right under the limited liability company agreement to redeem their Class A Common Units ("OP Units") for shares of Welltower common stock or cash, at Welltower's sole discretion, as the initial member. Accordingly, we classify the non-Welltower OP Units held by such other members in permanent equity because Welltower may elect to issue shares of Welltower common stock to the non-Welltower members who choose to redeem their OP Units rather than using cash.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsCertain noncontrolling interests are redeemable at fair value. Accordingly, we record the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests at the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income or loss and its share of other comprehensive income or loss, and contributions or distributions or (ii) the redemption value. If the interests are redeemable in the future, we accrete the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until expected redemption, currently a weighted-average period of approximatelyfive years. In accordance with ASC 810, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified outside of permanent equity, as a mezzanine item, on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2023, the current redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests exceeded the carrying value of $290,605,000by$46,178,000.We entered into certain DownREIT partnerships which give a real estate seller the ability to exchange its property on a tax deferred basis for equity membership interests (“DownREIT Units”). The DownREIT Units may be redeemed any time following the first anniversary of the date of issuance at the election of the holders foroneshare of our common stock per unit or, at our option, cash. | c-1 |  |
| Revenue Recognition Policy Text Block | Revenue RecognitionFor our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical segments, a significant source of our revenue is generated through leasing arrangements and accounted for under ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842"). Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Leases in our Outpatient Medical portfolio typically include some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant and upon adoption of ASC 842, we elected the lessor practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease components resulting in presenting all revenue associated with Outpatient Medical leases as leasing revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Certain payments made to tenants are treated as lease incentives and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. | c-1 |  |
