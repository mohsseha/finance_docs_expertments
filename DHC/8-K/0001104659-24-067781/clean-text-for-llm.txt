Forward-looking statements reflect DHC's current expectations, are based on judgments and assumptions, are inherently uncertain and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors, which could cause DHC's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from expected future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied in those forward-looking statements. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause DHC's actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: the impact of unfavorable market and commercial real
estate industry conditions due to possible reduced demand for healthcare related space and senior living communities, high interest rates, wage and commodity price inflation,
limited labor availability, increased insurance costs, supply chain disruptions, volatility in the public equity and debt markets, pandemics, geopolitical instability and tensions,
economic downturns or a possible recession or changes in real estate utilization, among other things, on DHC and its managers and other operators and tenants; DHC's senior
living operators' abilities to successfully and profitably operate the communities they manage for DHC; the continuing impact of changing market practices, including those that
arose or intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, or delayed returns to prior market practices on DHC and its managers and other operators and tenants, such as reduced
demand for leased medical office, life science and other space of DHC and residencies at senior living communities, increased operating costs and labor availability constraints;
the financial strength of DHC's managers and other operators and tenants; whether the aging U.S. population and increasing life spans of seniors will increase the demand for
senior living communities and other medical and healthcare related properties and healthcare services; whether DHC’s tenants will renew or extend their leases or whether DHC
will obtain replacement tenants on terms as favorable to DHC as its prior leases; the likelihood that DHC's tenants and residents will pay rent or be negatively impacted by
continuing unfavorable market and commercial real estate industry conditions; DHC’s managers’ abilities to increase or maintain rates charged to residents of DHC’s senior living
communities and manage operating costs for those communities; DHC's ability to increase or maintain occupancy at its properties on terms desirable to DHC; DHC's ability to
increase rents when its leases expire or renew; costs DHC incurs and concessions it grants to lease its properties; risk and uncertainties regarding the costs and timing of
development, redevelopment and repositioning activities, including as a result of prolonged high inflation, cost overruns, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, construction
delays or inability to obtain necessary permits or volatility in the commercial real estate markets; DHC's ability to manage its capital expenditures and other operating costs
effectively and to maintain and enhance its properties and their appeal to tenants and residents; DHC's ability to effectively raise and balance its use of debt and equity capital;
DHC’s ability to comply with the financial covenants under its debt agreements; DHC's ability to make required payments on its debt; DHC's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity
and otherwise manage leverage; DHC's credit ratings; DHC’s ability to sell properties at prices or returns it targets; DHC's ability to sell additional equity interests in, or
contribute additional properties to, its existing joint ventures, or enter into additional real estate joint ventures or to attract co-venturers and benefit from DHC's existing joint
ventures or any real estate joint ventures it may enter into; DHC's ability to acquire, develop, redevelop or reposition properties that realize its targeted returns; DHC’s ability to
pay distributions to its shareholders and to maintain or increase the amount of such distributions; the ability of RMR to successfully manage DHC; competition in the real estate
industry, particularly in those markets in which DHC’s properties are located; government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational
requirements; compliance with, and changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations, accounting rules, tax laws and similar matters; exposure to litigation and regulatory
and government proceedings due to the nature of the senior living and other health and wellness related service businesses; actual and potential conflicts of interest with DHC's
related parties, including DHC’s Managing Trustees, RMR, ABP Trust, AlerisLife and others affiliated with them; limitations imposed by and DHC’s ability to satisfy complex rules
to maintain DHC’s qualification for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; acts of terrorism, outbreaks of pandemics or other public health safety events or
conditions, war or other hostilities, global climate change or other manmade or natural disasters beyond DHC’s control; and other matters.
These risks, uncertainties and other factors are not exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included in DHC's periodic filings. The
information contained in DHC's filings with the SEC, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in its periodic reports, or incorporated therein, identifies important factors that
could cause differences from the forward-looking statements in this presentation. DHC's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You should not

2024 Strategic Priorities Designed to Capture Near and Long Term Value
Financing Strategies • Executing strategy to lower financing costs, improve weighted average remaining
debt term and enhance our liquidity profile.
o CMBS financing executed in May secured by eight medical office and life
science properties, with gross proceeds of $120 million.
o Secured fixed rate debt with select SHOP communities.
CapEX • Continued investment into communities, focusing on high ROI projects.
o Major renovations stabilized ROI Target: 15%+
o Light refresh stabilized ROI Target: 8 – 10%
• 23 light refresh projects underway totaling $25.7 million, with estimated Q4 2024
delivery.
SHOP • Ongoing performance review of communities and operators to ensure optimal
performance.
• Transitioned operations of 13 communities to Charter Senior Living. We estimate
these communities when stabilized will contribute to a 60 bps margin improvement
and a 70 bps occupancy improvement to the SHOP portfolio.
Select Property Sales • Marketing the sale of eight non-core, underperforming properties, collectively 30%
occupied, with expected proceeds of $50 million – $60 million.
• Evaluate broader portfolio strategies across SHOP and Medical Office / Life Science
portfolio for potential dispositions or strategic alternatives.
Focused on the execution of strategic priorities and increasing total shareholder returns.

Management aligned with shareholder interests
RMR base management fee tied to DHC share price performance
• Consists of an annual fee based on 50 bps of the lower of: (1) DHC’s
historical cost of real estate, or (2) DHC’s total market capitalization.
• There is no incentive for RMR to complete any transaction that could
reduce DHC’s share price.
RMR incentive fees are contingent on total shareholder return
outperformance
• Equal to 12% of value generated by DHC in excess of the benchmark
index total returns (MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care REIT Index)1 per share
over a three year period, subject to a cap (1.5% of equity market cap).
• Outperformance must be positive: it can’t be the best of the worst.
• Shareholders keep 100% of benchmark returns and at least 88% of
returns in excess of the benchmark.
Other fees
• Property management fee: consists of an annual fee based on 3.0% of
rents collected at DHC’s medical office, life science and active adult
properties.
• Construction supervision fee based on project costs.
Alignment of Interests
If DHC’s total market cap exceeds historical cost of
real estate, base fee is paid on assets.
If DHC’s total market cap is less than historical cost
of real estate, base fee fluctuates with share price.
Incentive fee structure keeps RMR focused on
increasing total shareholder return.
Members of RMR senior management are holders of
DHC shares, some subject to long term lock up
agreements.
DHC shareholders have visibility into publicly traded
RMR.
DHC benefits from RMR’s national footprint and
economies of scale of a $41 billionplatform.

NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI
The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more
closely related to our property level results of operations. We calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI as shown in this appendix. We define NOI
as income from our real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that we record as
depreciation and amortization. We define Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash
amortization included in property operating expenses. We calculate same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI in the same manner that we calculate the corresponding NOI and
cash basis NOI amounts, except that we only include same properties in calculating same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI. We use NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI
and same property cash basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same
property NOI and same property cash basis NOI differently than we do.
FFO and Normalized FFO
We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown in this appendix. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding
any gain or loss on sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including
adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of FFO of our equity method investment in AlerisLife and our proportionate share of FFO from our unconsolidated joint ventures, plus real
estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties and, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items
shown in this appendix. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors
include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing our debt, the availability to us of debt and equity
capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies
and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We present certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same
property Cash Basis NOI, funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities
in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be
considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated statements of income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental
measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain
historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash
Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both
investors and management to understand the operations of our properties.
