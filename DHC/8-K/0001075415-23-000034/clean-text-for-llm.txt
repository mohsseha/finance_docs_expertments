Q3 2023 3 "During the third quarter, our normalized FFO increased by $22.5  million over the prior year, driven by improved SHOP operations,  including a 13.2% revenue increase, a 370 basis-point occupancy  increase to 78.4%, and a 7.0% increase in average monthly rate. While  the SHOP recovery remains uneven and pressured by higher operating  expenses, our operators continue to achieve rental rate growth and  occupancy gains above the industry benchmark for comparable  properties year over year. Our Office Portfolio remained resilient, with  strong leasing demand for our portfolio of high-quality assets,  evidenced by a 14.8% roll-up in rents, and we ended the quarter at  93.0% leased on a same property basis. In late September, following the termination of our merger agreement  with OPI, we engaged B. Riley Securities as a financial advisor to  evaluate our options to address our capital needs, including upcoming  debt maturities. In addition, we are engaging in discussions with our  bank group to extend our credit facility maturity date.  Finally, in  addition to deferring redevelopment capital, we have initiated the  disposition process for a number of assets in each of our operating  segments to provide liquidity for us to execute on our business plan."

Bylaw  Amendment • DHC's bylaws have been amended to reduce the maximum percentage ownership of DHC common shares allowed to be owned  from 9.8% to 5% in order to preserve its cumulative net operating losses, which can be used to offset any projected taxable gains  on possible asset sales. This new ownership limitation is applicable on a prospective basis and any owner of more than 5% of  DHC's common shares as of November 1, 2023 is not required to reduce their ownership to meet this requirement.

Q3 2023 31 The Company: DHC is a REIT focused on owning high-quality healthcare properties located  throughout the United States. DHC seeks diversification across the health services  spectrum by care delivery and practice type, by scientific research disciplines and by  property type and location. As of September 30, 2023, DHC’s approximately $7.2  billion portfolio included 376 properties in 36 states and Washington, D.C., occupied  by approximately 500 tenants, and totaling approximately 9 million square feet of life  science and medical office properties and more than 27,000 senior living units. DHC is included in 148 market indices and comprises more than 1% of the following  indices as of September 30, 2023: BI North America Healthcare REIT Valuation Peers  (BIHLCRNP), Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Mid Cap Index (BBREMIDC),  Invesco S&P SmallCap 600 Pure Value ETF INAV Index (RZVIV) and Invesco FTSE RAFI  US 1500 Small-Mid ETF INAV Index (PRFZIV). Management: DHC is managed by The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR). RMR is an alternative asset  management company that is focused on commercial real estate and related  businesses. RMR primarily provides management services to publicly traded real  estate companies, privately held real estate funds and real estate related operating  businesses. As of September 30, 2023, RMR had approximately $36 billion of real  estate assets under management and the combined RMR managed companies had  more than $5 billion of annual revenues, over 2,000 properties and over 20,000  employees. DHC believes that being managed by RMR is a competitive advantage for  DHC because of RMR’s depth of management and experience in the real estate  industry. DHC also believes RMR provides management services to it at costs that are  lower than DHC would have to pay for similar quality services if DHC were self  managed.

Q3 2023 33 Non-GAAP Financial Measures DHC presents certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same property Cash Basis NOI,  earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or  Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of DHC's operating  performance or as measures of DHC's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in DHC's condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). DHC considers  these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). DHC believes these measures provide useful information to investors because by  excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of DHC's operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI,  Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management  to understand the operations of DHC's properties. NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's  property level results of operations. DHC calculates NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI as shown on pages 37 through 43. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its  property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that DHC records as depreciation and amortization. DHC defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI  excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fee amortization, if any, and non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses. DHC calculates same property  NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner that it calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI amounts, except that it only includes same properties in calculating same property NOI and  same property Cash Basis NOI. DHC uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance. Other real estate companies  and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI differently than DHC does. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre DHC calculates EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 44. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA,  excluding gains or losses on the sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, impairment of assets, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of  EBITDAre of DHC's former equity method investment in AlerisLife for the periods DHC had an equity investment in AlerisLife that it accounted for as an equity method investment and DHC's proportionate share of  EBITDAre from its unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 44. Other real estate  companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre differently than DHC does. FFO and Normalized FFO DHC calculates FFO and Normalized FFO as shown on page 45. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of  properties, equity in net earnings or losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's  proportionate share of FFO of DHC's former equity method investment in AlerisLife for the periods DHC had an equity investment in AlerisLife that it accounted for as an equity method investment and DHC's  proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In  calculating Normalized FFO, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 45, including similar adjustments for DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures, if any. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by  DHC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to its shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain DHC's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in  the agreements governing DHC's debt, the availability to DHC of debt and equity capital, DHC's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance, and DHC's expected needs for and availability  of cash to pay its obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than DHC does. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
