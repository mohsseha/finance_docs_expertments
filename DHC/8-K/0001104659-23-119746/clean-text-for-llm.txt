Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election

On November 17, 2023, our Board of Trustees,
or the Board, appointed Christopher J. Bilotto as our President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2024.
Mr. Bilotto
,
age 46, has been an executive vice president of our manager, The RMR Group LLC, or RMR, since October 2023, senior vice
president of RMR from October 2020 to September 2023 and a vice president of RMR from 2016 to September 2020.
Mr. Bilotto is responsible for overseeing portfolio management for all office, industrial and retail properties managed by RMR
and hotel and senior living asset management, as well as development and redevelopment across the United States. Prior to joining
RMR in 2011, Mr. Bilotto worked at General Growth Properties in various management roles.
Mr. Bilotto
currently serves as president and chief executive officer of Office Properties Income Trust, but he has resigned from those
positions effective December 31, 2023.
There is no arrangement or understanding between
Mr. Bilotto
and any other person pursuant to which
Mr. Bilotto
was appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer. There are no transactions, relationships or agreements between
Mr. Bilotto
and us that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
Mr. Bilotto
does not have a family relationship with any member of the Board or any of our executive officers.
Mr. Bilotto
will replace Jennifer F. Francis, who is retiring from RMR on June 30, 2024, and therefore has resigned as our President and Chief
Executive Officer, effective December 31, 2023.
In connection
with Mr. Bilotto’s appointment as our President and Chief Executive Offer, we will enter into an indemnification agreement
with Mr. Bilotto, which agreement will be on substantially the same terms as the indemnification agreements we have entered with
our Trustees and other executive officers. We have previously filed a form of indemnification agreement as
Exhibit 10.6
to our Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, which form is incorporated herein by reference.
