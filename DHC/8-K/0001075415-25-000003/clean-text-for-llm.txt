Exhibit 99.1
DIVERSIFIED HEALTHCARE TRUST
Introduction to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
On January 31, 2025, Diversified Healthcare Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, or DHC, completed the sale of three life science properties with approximately 186,000 rentable square feet located at 3030, 3040 and 3050 Science Park Road, San Diego, California, or MUSE, for a net sales price of $159.0 million, excluding closing costs.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 reflects DHC's financial position as if the sale of MUSE was completed as of September 30, 2024. The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect DHC's results of operations as if the sale of MUSE was completed on January 1, 2023. These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with (i) DHC's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the notes thereto, included in DHC's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on November 4, 2024 and (ii) DHC's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the notes thereto, included in DHC's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.
These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are provided for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of DHC's expected financial position or results of operations for any future period. Differences could result from numerous factors, including future changes in DHC's portfolio of investments, capital structure, property level operating expenses and revenues, including rents expected to be received pursuant to DHC's existing leases or leases DHC may enter into, changes in interest rates and other reasons. Actual future results are likely to be different from amounts presented in these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements and such differences may be significant. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to reflect, in all material respects, the effects of the sale of MUSE have been included.
