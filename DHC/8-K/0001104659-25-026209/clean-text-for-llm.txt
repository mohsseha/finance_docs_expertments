Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election
of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On March 20, 2025,
pursuant
to the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee,
our Board of Trustees, or
the
Board, elected Alan L. Felder as an Independent Trustee with a term to expire at our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders. In connection
with Mr. Felder’s election,
the Board increased the size of the Board from seven members to eight members. The Board appointed
Mr. Felder to serve on the Audit Committee.
Mr.
Felder, age 53, previously worked at UBS Investment Bank, or UBS, from 2001 to 2024, where he most recently served as the Head of
Real Estate, Lodging and Leisure, Americas. Mr. Felder previously held other roles at UBS, including Head of Private Financing
Markets, Americas and a Managing Director in the Mergers and Acquisitions Group. Prior to joining UBS, Mr. Felder worked
in investment banking at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, focusing on capital markets and mergers and acquisitions transactions. He
graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
The Board
concluded that Mr. Felder is qualified to serve as an Independent Trustee in accordance with the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC, the Securities and Exchange Commission and our governing documents. For his service as an Independent Trustee, Mr. Felder
will be entitled to the compensation we generally provide to Independent Trustees. There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Felder
and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Felder was selected as a Trustee. There are no transactions, relationships or agreements
between Mr. Felder and us that would require disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Mr. Felder does not have a family relationship with any member of the Board or any of our executive
officers.
In connection
with Mr. Felder’s election as an Independent Trustee, we will enter into an indemnification agreement with Mr. Felder,
which agreement will be on substantially the same terms as the indemnification agreements we have entered with our other Trustees and
executive officers. We have previously filed a form of indemnification agreement as
Exhibit 10.1
to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which form is incorporated herein by reference.

Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
