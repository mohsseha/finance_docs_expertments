Our year over year SHOP results reflect a 200 basis  point occupancy increase, supporting NOI growth of 43% and a  related 180 basis point margin expansion. Within our Medical Office  and Life Science Portfolio, we achieved 11% rent growth for signed  leases during the quarter, which marks our third consecutive quarter of  double digit rent growth, further demonstrating strength within these  sectors.  Looking ahead, the guidance we provided on our fourth quarter 2023  earnings call remains unchanged as we continue to advance key  initiatives to further strengthen our capital and liquidity position and  drive performance across our portfolio."

Q1 2024 29 The Company: DHC is a REIT focused on owning high-quality healthcare properties located  throughout the United States. DHC seeks diversification across the health services  spectrum by care delivery and practice type, by scientific research disciplines and by  property type and location. As of March 31, 2024, DHC’s approximately $7.2 billion  portfolio included 371 properties in 36 states and Washington, D.C., occupied by  approximately 500 tenants, and totaling approximately 8.5 million square feet of life  science and medical office properties and more than 27,000 senior living units. DHC is included in 121 market indices and comprises more than 1% of the following  indices as of March 31, 2024: BI North America Healthcare REIT Valuation Peers  (BIHLCRNP), Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Mid Cap Index (BBREMIDC),  Invesco S&P SmallCap 600 Pure Value ETF INAV Index (RZVIV) and Invesco FTSE RAFI  US 1500 Small-Mid ETF INAV Index (PRFZIV). Management: DHC is managed by The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR). RMR is an alternative asset  management company that is focused on commercial real estate and related  businesses. RMR primarily provides management services to publicly traded real  estate companies, privately held real estate funds and real estate related operating  businesses. As of March 31, 2024, RMR had over $41 billion of real estate assets under  management and the combined RMR managed companies had more than $5 billion  of annual revenues, approximately 2,100 properties and over 20,000 employees. DHC  believes that being managed by RMR is a competitive advantage for DHC because of  RMR’s depth of management and experience in the real estate industry. DHC also  believes RMR provides management services to it at costs that are lower than DHC  would have to pay for similar quality services if DHC were self-managed.

Q1 2024 35 Non-GAAP Financial Measures DHC presents certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same property Cash Basis NOI,  earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or  Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of DHC's operating  performance or as measures of DHC's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in DHC's condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). DHC considers  these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). DHC believes these measures provide useful information to investors because by  excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of DHC's operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI,  Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management  to understand the operations of DHC's properties. NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's  property level results of operations. DHC calculates NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI as shown on pages 31 and 32. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its  property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that DHC records as depreciation and amortization. DHC defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI  excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses. DHC calculates same property NOI and  same property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner that it calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI amounts, except that it only includes same properties in calculating same property NOI and same  property Cash Basis NOI. DHC uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and  REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI differently than DHC does. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre DHC calculates EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 33. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA,  excluding gains or losses on the sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, impairment of real estate assets, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of EBITDAre of  DHC's equity method investees, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 33 and include business management  incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating  performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. Other real  estate companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre differently than DHC does. FFO and Normalized FFO DHC calculates FFO and Normalized FFO as shown on page 34. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of  properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of FFO of  DHC's equity method investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Normalized FFO, DHC  adjusts for the items shown on page 34, including similar adjustments for DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter  when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business  management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by DHC's Board of  Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to its shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain DHC's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements  governing DHC's debt, the availability to DHC of debt and equity capital, DHC's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance, and DHC's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its  obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than DHC does. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q1 2024 36 Adjusted total assets Adjusted total assets is the original cost of real estate assets calculated in accordance with GAAP before depreciation and after impairment write downs, if any, and excludes  accounts receivable and intangible assets.

In calculating net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, DHC recognizes estimated business management incentive fee expense,  if any, in the first, second and third quarters. Although DHC recognizes this expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters for the purpose of calculating net income (loss), DHC does not  include these amounts in the calculation of Normalized FFO or Adjusted EBITDAre until the fourth quarter, when the amount of business management incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if  any, is determined.  Cash basis NOI margin % Cash basis NOI margin % is defined as cash basis NOI as a percentage of cash basis rental income. Cash basis rental income excludes non-cash straight line rent  adjustments, lease value amortization and lease termination fees, if any. Consolidated income available for debt service Consolidated income available for debt service is earnings from operations excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes, loss on  asset impairment, gains or losses on equity securities, gains or losses on sales of properties and modification or early extinguishment of debt, determined together with debt service for the  applicable period. Coupon rate Coupon rate is the interest rate stated in, or determined pursuant to, the contract terms. Development, redevelopment and other activities Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditures that reposition a property or result in new sources of  revenue. From time to time DHC invests in revenue producing capital improvements at certain of its triple net leased senior living communities. As a result, annual rents payable to DHC increase  pursuant to the terms of the applicable leases. These capital improvements are not included in DHC's development, redevelopment and other activities. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions (continued) RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS

A small percentage of DHC's medical office and life science property leases are full-service leases where DHC  receives fixed rent from its tenants and no reimbursement for its property operating costs. Other operator managed communities Other operator managed communities are senior living communities in DHC's SHOP segment, which are managed by third party managers other than Five  Star. Principal balance Principal balances are the amounts stated in the contracts less the principal amount of any repayments made. In accordance with GAAP, DHC's carrying values and recorded interest  expense may be different because of market conditions at the time DHC assumed certain of these debts.  Rent coverage  Rent coverage is calculated using the annualized operating cash flows from our triple net lease tenants' operations of our properties, before subordinated charges, if any, divided by  annualized rental income. DHC has not independently verified tenant operating data. Excludes data for historical periods prior to DHC's ownership of certain properties, as well as data for properties  sold or classified as held for sale, if any, or for which there was a transfer of operations during the periods presented.
