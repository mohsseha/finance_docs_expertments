Q4 2024 3 "DHC ended the fourth quarter by reaching 80% SHOP  occupancy for the first time since the first quarter of 2020. On a  year-over-year basis, DHC achieved a 56% improvement in SHOP  NOI, a 7.3% increase in SHOP revenues and a 6.7% improvement  in average monthly rate, resulting in margin expansion of 250  basis points. We are pleased with the results achieved and  remain bullish on the outlook within the sector and our SHOP  portfolio going into 2025. Over the recent quarters, we have advanced several initiatives to  effectively manage our upcoming debt maturities due in 2025  and 2026. These efforts are bolstered by $340 million in  anticipated mortgage loan proceeds primarily from signed term  sheets, progress on our disposition strategy, with $26 million in  proceeds from sales of unencumbered assets since October 1st,  and $77 million of potential proceeds from sales of additional  unencumbered assets currently under agreements or letters of  intent. Furthermore, our cash balance was $145 million at year  end. We have also started to address our January 2026 debt  maturities by generating $159 million in proceeds from the  January 2025 sale of MUSE and $142 million in proceeds from 19  properties which are under agreements to sell and expected to  close in the first quarter. These sales represent an expected 25%  premium over the allocated fair values of these properties."

Q4 2024 30 The Company: DHC is a REIT focused on owning high-quality healthcare properties located  throughout the United States. DHC seeks diversification across the health services  spectrum by care delivery and practice type, by scientific research disciplines and by  property type and location. As of December 31, 2024, DHC’s approximately $7.2  billion portfolio included 367 properties in 36 states and Washington, D.C., occupied  by approximately 450 tenants, and totaling approximately 8.0 million square feet of  medical office and life science properties and more than 27,000 senior living units. Management: DHC is managed by The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR). RMR is an alternative asset  management company that is focused on commercial real estate and related  businesses. RMR primarily provides management services to publicly traded real  estate companies, privately held real estate funds and real estate related operating  businesses. As of December 31, 2024, RMR had over $40 billion of real estate assets  under management and the combined RMR managed companies had more than $5  billion of annual revenues, approximately 2,000 properties and over 18,000  employees. DHC believes that being managed by RMR is a competitive advantage for  DHC because of RMR’s depth of management and experience in the real estate  industry. DHC also believes RMR provides management services to it at costs that are  lower than DHC would have to pay for similar quality services if DHC were self- managed.

Q4 2024 37 Non-GAAP Financial Measures DHC presents certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same  property Cash Basis NOI, earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, funds from operations, or FFO, normalized funds from operations,  or Normalized FFO, and cash available for distribution, or CAD. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as  indicators of DHC's operating performance or as measures of DHC's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in DHC's consolidated statements of income (loss). DHC  considers these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). DHC believes these measures provide useful information to investors because by  excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of DHC's operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash Basis  NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the  operations of DHC's properties. NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's property level  results of operations. DHC calculates NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI as shown on pages 32 and 33. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its property operating expenses.  NOI excludes depreciation and amortization. DHC defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in  property operating expenses. DHC calculates same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner that it calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI amounts, except that it only includes same  properties in calculating same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI. DHC uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level  performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI differently than DHC does. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre DHC calculates EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 34. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA, excluding gains  or losses on the sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, impairment of real estate assets, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of EBITDAre of DHC's equity method investees,  as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 34 and includes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter  versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of DHC's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such  business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre and  Adjusted EBITDAre differently than DHC does. FFO and Normalized FFO DHC calculates FFO and Normalized FFO as shown on page 35. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties,  equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of FFO of DHC's equity method  investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Normalized FFO, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 35,  including similar adjustments for DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in  accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of DHC's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all  contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by DHC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to its  shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain DHC's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing DHC's debt, the availability to DHC of debt and equity capital,  DHC's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance and DHC's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and  Normalized FFO differently than DHC does. Cash Available for Distribution DHC calculates CAD as shown on page 36. DHC defines CAD as Normalized FFO minus DHC's proportionate share of Normalized FFO from unconsolidated joint venture properties and its equity method investment, plus operating  cash flow distributions received from DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures and equity method investment, if any, recurring real estate related capital expenditures, adjustments for other non-cash and nonrecurring items, certain  amounts excluded from Normalized FFO but settled in cash, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. CAD is among the factors considered by DHC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of  distributions to DHC's shareholders. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate CAD differently than DHC does. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS

In calculating net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, DHC recognizes estimated business management incentive fee expense,  if any, in the first, second and third quarters. Although DHC recognizes this expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters for the purpose of calculating net income (loss), DHC does not  include these amounts in the calculation of Normalized FFO or Adjusted EBITDAre until the fourth quarter, when the amount of business management incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if  any, is determined.  Cash basis NOI margin % Cash basis NOI margin % is defined as cash basis NOI as a percentage of cash basis rental income. Cash basis rental income excludes non-cash straight line rent  adjustments, lease value amortization and lease termination fees, if any. Consolidated income available for debt service Consolidated income available for debt service is earnings from operations excluding interest expense, depreciation and amortization, taxes, loss on  asset impairment, gains or losses on equity securities, gains or losses on sales of properties and modification or early extinguishment of debt, determined together with debt service for the  applicable period. Core-Based Statistical Areas Core-Based Statistical Areas, or CBSAs, are geographic regions that identify areas as either metropolitan or micropolitan or neither. The Office of Management and  Budget defined CBSAs in 2000. CBSAs are reclassified in every census using a combination of data and census information.

Q4 2024 39 Development, redevelopment and other activities Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditures that reposition a property or result in new sources of  revenue. From time to time DHC invests in revenue producing capital improvements at certain of its triple net leased senior living communities. As a result, annual rents payable to DHC increase  pursuant to the terms of the applicable leases. These capital improvements are not included in DHC's development, redevelopment and other activities.
