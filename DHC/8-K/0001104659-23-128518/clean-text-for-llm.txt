Senior Secured Notes Transaction
On
December 21, 2023, we completed a private offering of $940,534,000 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured notes due
2026, or the Notes.
The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $732 million, after initial purchaser discounts and estimated
offering costs. We used approximately $450 million of these net proceeds to repay in full our secured credit facility and will use approximately
$250 million of these net proceeds to redeem in full our outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2024, each as further described below, and
will use the excess proceeds to pay fees and expenses associated with such repayment and redemption and for general business purposes.
After purchasing the Notes from us, the initial
purchasers offered and sold the Notes only to persons reasonably believed
to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the
Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and outside the United States to non-United States persons in compliance with Regulation S
under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities law and may not be
offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
The Notes
and
the guarantees thereof
were issued under an indenture, dated as of December 21, 2023, or the Indenture, among us, the Collateral
Guarantors and the Non-Collateral Guarantors (each as defined below), and
U.S. Bank Trust Company,
National Association, or U.S. Bank, as trustee and collateral agent.
No cash interest
will accrue on the Notes prior to maturity, unless we elect to exercise the extension option described below. The Notes will have an initial
accreted value of $797.42 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, which was the offering price of the Notes to investors in the offering.
The accreted value of each Note will increase from the date of issuance until January 15, 2026, the maturity date of the Notes, at a rate
of 11.25% per annum compounded semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, such that the accreted value will equal the principal
amount at maturity of each Note on that date.
We have a
one-time option to extend the maturity date of the Notes by one year, to January 15, 2027, without the consent of the noteholders, subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. If we exercise this option, interest payments will be due semiannually
during the extension period at an initial interest rate of 11.25% with increases of 50 basis points every 90 days that the Notes remain
outstanding.
The Notes
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and senior secured basis, by certain of our subsidiaries that own 95 properties
with an estimated fair value of approximately $1.57 billion, or the Collateral Guarantors, and on a joint, several and unsecured basis,
by all our subsidiaries that currently guarantee our 9.750% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 that do not own
the collateral properties, or the Non-Collateral Guarantors. The Notes and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors will be
secured by a first-priority lien and security interest on each of the collateral properties and 100% of the equity interests in each of
the Collateral Guarantors.
The Notes are subject to certain restrictive financial
and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties,
in excess of calculated amounts and require us to maintain certain
financial
ratios.
Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers
are lenders under our secured credit facility and therefore may receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering. Additionally,
certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates hold a portion of our 4.750% senior notes due 2024 and therefore may
receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering.
The foregoing description of the Notes
is
not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the
Indenture attached hereto as Exhibit
4.1, which is incorporated by reference herein.
Repayment and Termination of Secured Credit Facility
In connection with the closing of the offering
of the Notes, on December 21, 2023, we repaid the $450 million outstanding under our secured credit facility with
Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and a lender, and a syndicate of other lenders,
and then terminated the
agreement governing that facility in accordance with its terms and without penalty.
The foregoing description of the agreement governing
our terminated credit facility
is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by
reference to the conformed copy of the
credit agreement, as amended, that was previously filed as
Exhibit 10.1
to
our Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 14, 2023.
2024 Notes Redemption
Following
the closing of the offering of the Notes, on December 21, 2023, we delivered a notice of redemption to U.S. Bank, as successor trustee
to U.S. Bank National Association, with respect to all of our outstanding
4.750% senior notes due 2024,
for
a redemption price equal to the principal amount of $250 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the date of redemption.
The redemption date is January 20, 2024 and payment of the redemption price is expected to occur on or about January 22, 2024. This Current
Report on Form 8-K does not constitute notices of redemption with respect to our
4.750% senior notes due 2024
.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On December
20, 2023, we and ABP Trust agreed that our right to purchase common shares of AlerisLife Inc. pursuant to the Consent and Amendment Agreement,
dated as of February 2, 2023, among us and our applicable subsidiaries, and ABP Trust, its applicable subsidiaries and Adam D. Portnoy,

31, 2024.
