and uncertainties. These statements may include words such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “may” and negatives or derivatives of these or
similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about: DHC’s 2025 guidance, including with respect to potential dispositions, capital
expenditures, targeted net operating income (“NOI”) increase and occupancy growth; DHC’s senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”) operator strategic initiatives, including
NOI and margin growth, implementation of standard operating procedures and revenue management and expense control; capital recycling plans, including expected timing of
dispositions and amount of use of proceeds from dispositions; DHC’s strategy to strengthen its balance sheet, including its plans to address upcoming debt maturities with
anticipated mortgage loan proceeds and potential additional debt and DHC’s potential exercise of its option to extend the maturity date of its zero coupon senior secured notes;
the performance of its SHOP, Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and Triple Net Leased Senior Living and Wellness Centers segments; demand for medical office and life
science properties and senior living communities; and expected favorable senior living industry trends and positive pharmaceutical and medical research industry fundamentals.
Forward-looking statements reflect DHC's current expectations, are based on judgments and assumptions, are inherently uncertain and are subject to risks, uncertainties and
other factors, which could cause DHC's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from expected future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied in those forward-looking statements. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause DHC's actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: the impact of unfavorable market and commercial real
estate industry conditions due to possible reduced demand for healthcare related space and senior living communities, uncertainties surrounding interest rates, wage and
commodity price inflation, supply chain disruptions, volatility in the public debt and equity markets, pandemics, geopolitical instability and tensions, economic uncertainties,
labor market conditions or changes in real estate utilization, among other things, on DHC and its managers and other operators and tenants; DHC's senior living operators'
abilities to successfully and profitably operate the communities they manage for DHC; the continuing impact of changing market practices on DHC and its managers and other
operators and tenants, such as delayed recovery of the senior living industry, reduced demand for leased medical office, life science and other space of DHC and residencies at
senior living communities and increased operating costs; the financial strength of DHC's managers and other operators and tenants; whether the aging U.S. population and
increasing life spans of seniors will increase the demand for senior living communities and other medical and healthcare related properties and healthcare services; whether
DHC’s tenants will renew or extend their leases or whether DHC will obtain replacement tenants on terms as favorable to DHC as its prior leases; the likelihood that DHC's
tenants and residents will pay rent or be negatively impacted by continuing unfavorable market and commercial real estate industry conditions; DHC’s managers’ abilities to
increase or maintain rates charged to residents of DHC’s senior living communities and manage operating costs for those communities; DHC's ability to increase or maintain
occupancy at its properties on terms desirable to DHC; DHC's ability to increase rents when its leases expire or renew; costs DHC incurs and concessions it grants to lease its
properties; risk and uncertainties regarding the costs and timing of development, redevelopment and repositioning activities, including as a result of inflation, cost overruns,
supply chain challenges, labor shortages, construction delays or inability to obtain necessary permits or volatility in the commercial real estate markets; DHC's ability to manage
its capital expenditures and other operating costs effectively and to maintain and enhance its properties and their appeal to tenants and residents; DHC's ability to effectively
raise and balance its use of debt and equity capital; DHC’s ability to comply with the financial covenants under its debt agreements; DHC's ability to make required payments on
its debt; DHC's ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and otherwise manage leverage; DHC's credit ratings; DHC’s ability to sell properties at prices or returns it targets, and the
timing of such sales; DHC's ability to sell additional equity interests in, or contribute additional properties to, its existing joint ventures, or enter into additional real estate joint
ventures or to attract co-venturers and benefit from DHC's existing joint ventures or any real estate joint ventures it may enter into; DHC's ability to acquire, develop, redevelop or
reposition properties that realize its targeted returns; DHC’s ability to pay distributions to its shareholders and to maintain or increase the amount of such distributions; the ability
of RMR to successfully manage DHC; competition in the real estate industry, particularly in those markets in which DHC’s properties are located; government regulations affecting
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational requirements; compliance with, and changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations, accounting rules, tax
laws and similar matters; exposure to litigation and regulatory and government proceedings due to the nature of the senior living and other health and wellness related service
businesses; actual and potential conflicts of interest with DHC's related parties, including DHC’s Managing Trustees, RMR, ABP Trust, AlerisLife and others affiliated with them;
limitations imposed by and DHC’s ability to satisfy complex rules to maintain DHC’s qualification for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; acts of terrorism,
outbreaks of pandemics or other public health safety events or conditions, war or other hostilities, global climate change or other manmade or natural disasters beyond DHC’s
control; and other matters.
These risks, uncertainties and other factors are not exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included in DHC's periodic filings. The
information contained in DHC's filings with the SEC, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in its periodic reports, or incorporated therein, identifies important factors that
could cause differences from the forward-looking statements in this presentation. DHC's filings with the SEC are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You should not
place undue reliance upon DHC's forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, DHC does not intend to update or change any forward-looking statements as a result

operating these properties in a manner that benefits our
shareholders, tenants and the communities in which we are
located. We seek to operate those properties in ways that improve
the economic performance of their operations, while
simultaneously ensuring tenant comfort and safety and managing
energy and water consumption, as well as greenhouse gas
emissions.
Our strategy for our SHOP segment is to work with our operators to
prioritize the safety and well-being of our residents, while also
seeking to maximize the operating efficiencies of our senior living
communities.

Management aligned with shareholder interests
RMR base management fee tied to DHC share price performance
• Consists of an annual fee based on 50 bps of the lower of: (1) DHC’s
historical cost of real estate, or (2) DHC’s total market capitalization.
• There is no incentive for RMR to complete any transaction that could
reduce DHC’s share price.
RMR incentive fees are contingent on total shareholder return
outperformance
• Equal to 12% of value generated by DHC in excess of the benchmark
index total returns (MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care REIT Index) per share
over a three year period, subject to a cap (1.5% of equity market cap).
• Outperformance must be positive: it can’t be the best of the worst.
• Shareholders keep 100% of benchmark returns and at least 88% of
returns in excess of the benchmark.
Other fees
• Property management fee: consists of an annual fee based on 3.0% of
rents collected at DHC’s medical office, life science and active adult
properties.
• Construction supervision fee based on project costs.
Alignment of Interests
If DHC’s total market cap exceeds historical cost of
real estate, base fee is paid on assets.
If DHC’s total market cap is less than historical cost
of real estate, base fee fluctuates with share price.
Incentive fee structure keeps RMR focused on
increasing total shareholder return.
Members of RMR senior management are holders of
DHC shares, some subject to long term lock up
agreements.
DHC shareholders have visibility into publicly traded
RMR.
DHC benefits from RMR’s national footprint and
economies of scale of a $40 billionplatform.

NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI
The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more
closely related to our property level results of operations. We calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI as shown in this appendix. We define NOI
as income from our real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization. We define Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent
adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses. We calculate same property NOI and same property
cash basis NOI in the same manner that we calculate the corresponding NOI and cash basis NOI amounts, except that we only include same properties in calculating same property NOI and
same property cash basis NOI. We use NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance.
Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI differently than we do.
FFO and Normalized FFO
We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown in this appendix. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding
any gain or loss on sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including
adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of FFO of our equity method investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other
adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items shown in this appendix, including similar adjustments for our unconsolidated joint ventures, if
any, and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their
quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all
contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining
the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements
governing our debt, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability
of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We present certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same
property Cash Basis NOI, funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in
accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be
considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated statements of income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental
measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain
historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash
Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both
investors and management to understand the operations of our properties.
