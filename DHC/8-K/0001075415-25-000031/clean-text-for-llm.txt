Q2 2025 3 "During the second quarter, we delivered solid results across our  portfolio. In our SHOP segment, we continue to see a meaningful  improvement in same property NOI, which increased 18.5% year  over year to $37.4 million. In our Medical Office and Life Science  segment, we delivered same space weighted average rents that  were 11.5% higher than prior rents with an average lease term of  approximately 7 years, and our leasing pipeline remains very active. We have also made significant progress in addressing our  upcoming debt maturities. Since March 2025, DHC has completed  over $343 million of mortgage financings at a weighted average  interest rate of 6.54% and used the proceeds, along with cash on  hand, to fully redeem our senior unsecured notes due June 2025.  DHC also closed a new $150 million secured revolving credit facility,  providing added financial flexibility. With our 2025 notes now fully  repaid, we are focused on addressing the remaining $641 million of  our 2026 zero coupon notes, which we plan to redeem with  proceeds from a combination of asset sales and new financings. We  remain committed to reducing leverage and maintaining a strong  balance sheet while positioning DHC to deliver attractive returns for  our shareholders."

Q2 2025 30 The Company: DHC is a REIT focused on owning high-quality healthcare properties located  throughout the United States. DHC seeks diversification across the health services  spectrum by care delivery and practice type, by scientific research disciplines and by  property type and location. As of June 30, 2025, DHC’s approximately $6.8 billion  portfolio included 341 properties in 34 states and Washington, D.C., with more than  26,000 senior living units, approximately 7.4 million square feet of medical office and  life science properties and occupied by approximately 450 tenants. Management: DHC is managed by The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR). RMR is an alternative asset  management company that is focused on commercial real estate and related  businesses. RMR primarily provides management services to publicly traded real  estate companies, privately held real estate funds and real estate related operating  businesses. As of June 30, 2025, RMR had approximately $40 billion of real estate  assets under management and the combined RMR managed companies had more  than $5 billion of annual revenues, approximately 1,900 properties and over 18,000  employees. DHC believes that being managed by RMR is a competitive advantage for  DHC because of RMR’s depth of management and experience in the real estate  industry. DHC also believes RMR provides management services to it at costs that are  lower than DHC would have to pay for similar quality services if DHC were self- managed.

Q2 2025 37 Non-GAAP Financial Measures DHC presents certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property  NOI, same property Cash Basis NOI, earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, funds from operations, or FFO, normalized  funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, and cash available for distribution, or CAD. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered  alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of DHC's operating performance or as measures of DHC's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in DHC's  condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). DHC considers these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). DHC believes  these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of DHC's operating  performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and  incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of DHC's properties. NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's property  level results of operations. DHC calculates NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI as shown on pages 32 and 33. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its property  operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization. DHC defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non- cash amortization included in property operating expenses. DHC calculates same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner that it calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI  amounts, except that it only includes same properties in calculating same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI. DHC uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI to  evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI differently than DHC  does. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre DHC calculates EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 34. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA,  excluding gains or losses on the sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, impairment of real estate assets, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of EBITDAre of  DHC's equity method investees, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 34. Other real estate companies and  REITs may calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre differently than DHC does. FFO and Normalized FFO DHC calculates FFO and Normalized FFO as shown on page 35. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of  properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of FFO of  DHC's equity method investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Normalized FFO, DHC adjusts  for the items shown on page 35, including similar adjustments for DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and incentive management fees, if any. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by DHC's  Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to its shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain DHC's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the  agreements governing DHC's debt, the availability to DHC of debt and equity capital, DHC's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance and DHC's expected needs for and availability of  cash to pay its obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than DHC does. Cash Available for Distribution DHC calculates CAD as shown on page 36. DHC defines CAD as Normalized FFO minus DHC's proportionate share of Normalized FFO from unconsolidated joint venture properties and its equity method investment, plus  operating cash flow distributions received from DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures and equity method investment, if any, recurring real estate related capital expenditures, adjustments for other non-cash and  nonrecurring items, certain amounts excluded from Normalized FFO but settled in cash, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. CAD is among the factors considered by DHC's Board of  Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to DHC's shareholders. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate CAD differently than DHC does. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS

As a result, annual rents payable to  DHC increase pursuant to the terms of the applicable leases.
