statements may include words such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “may” and negatives or derivatives of these or similar expressions. These forward-looking
statements include, among others, statements about: DHC’s 2025 guidance, including with respect to potential dispositions, capital expenditures, targeted net operating income (“NOI”) increase and
occupancy growth; DHC’s senior housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”) operator strategic initiatives, including operator transitions, occupancy and margin growths, targeted sales and marketing
expenditures, expansion of care options, implementation of standard operating procedures and revenue management and expense control; capital recycling plans, including expected timing of
dispositions and amount of use of proceeds from dispositions; the value and quality of DHC’s SHOP properties; DHC’s refinancing strategy; the expected net proceeds and benefits to DHC from the
strategic transaction with AlerisLife Inc.; the performance of its SHOP, Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and Triple Net Leased (“NNN”) Senior Living and Wellness Centers segments; demand for
medical office and life science properties and senior living communities; and expected favorable senior living industry trends and strong medical office market and life science sector fundamentals.
Forward-looking statements reflect DHC’s current expectations, are based on judgments and assumptions, are inherently uncertain and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could
cause DHC’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from expected future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in those forward-looking statements. Some
of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause DHC’s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, the following: the impact of unfavorable market and commercial real estate industry conditions due to possible reduced demand for healthcare related space and senior living
communities, uncertainties surrounding interest rates, wage and commodity price inflation, supply chain disruptions, volatility in the public debt and equity markets, effects of or changes to tariffs or
trading policies, pandemics, geopolitical instability and tensions, economic uncertainties, labor market conditions or changes in real estate utilization, among other things, on DHC and its managers and
other operators and tenants; DHC’s senior living operators’ abilities to successfully and profitably operate the communities they manage for DHC; the continuing impact of changing market practices on
DHC and its managers and other operators and tenants, such as delayed recovery of the senior living industry, reduced demand for leased medical office, life science and other space of DHC and
residencies at senior living communities and increased operating costs; the financial strength of DHC’s managers and other operators and tenants; whether the aging U.S. population and increasing life
spans of seniors will increase the demand for senior living communities and other medical and healthcare related properties and healthcare services; whether DHC’s tenants will renew or extend their
leases or whether DHC will obtain replacement tenants on terms as favorable to DHC as its prior leases; the likelihood that DHC’s tenants and residents will pay rent or be negatively impacted by
continuing unfavorable market and commercial real estate industry conditions; DHC’s managers’ abilities to increase or maintain rates charged to residents of DHC’s senior living communities and
manage operating costs for those communities; DHC’s ability to increase or maintain occupancy at its properties on terms desirable to DHC; DHC’s ability to increase rents when its leases expire or
renew; costs DHC incurs and concessions it grants to lease its properties; risk and uncertainties regarding the costs and timing of development, redevelopment and repositioning activities, including as a
result of inflation, cost overruns, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, construction delays or inability to obtain necessary permits or volatility in the commercial real estate markets; DHC’s ability to
manage its capital expenditures and other operating costs effectively and to maintain and enhance its properties and their appeal to tenants and residents; DHC’s ability to effectively raise and balance
its use of debt and equity capital; DHC’s ability to purchase cost effective interest rate caps; DHC’s ability to comply with the financial covenants under its debt agreements; DHC’s ability to make
required payments on its debt; DHC’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, including the availability of borrowings under its revolving credit facility, and otherwise manage leverage; DHC’s credit ratings;
DHC’s ability to sell properties at prices or returns it targets, and the timing of such sales; DHC’s ability to sell additional equity interests in, or contribute additional properties to, its existing joint ventures,
or enter into additional real estate joint ventures or to attract co-venturers and benefit from DHC’s existing joint ventures or any real estate joint ventures it may enter into; DHC’s ability to acquire,
develop, redevelop or reposition properties that realize its targeted returns; non-performance by counterparties to DHC’s interest rate cap; DHC’s ability to pay distributions to its shareholders and to
maintain or increase the amount of such distributions; the ability of The RMR Group LLC (“RMR”) to successfully manage DHC; competition in the real estate industry, particularly in those markets in
which DHC’s properties are located; government regulations affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational requirements; compliance with, and changes to, federal, state and
local laws and regulations, accounting rules, tax laws and similar matters; exposure to litigation and regulatory and government proceedings due to the nature of the senior living and other health and
wellness related service businesses; actual and potential conflicts of interest with DHC’s related parties, including DHC’s Managing Trustees, RMR, ABP Trust, AlerisLife Inc. and others affiliated with them;
limitations imposed by and DHC’s ability to satisfy complex rules to maintain DHC’s qualification for taxation as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes; acts of
terrorism, outbreaks of pandemics or other public health safety events or conditions, war or other hostilities, global climate change or other manmade or natural disasters beyond DHC’s control; and
other matters.
These risks, uncertainties and other factors are not exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included in DHC’s periodic filings. The information contained in
DHC’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including under the caption “Risk Factors” in its periodic reports, or incorporated therein, identifies important factors that could cause
differences from the forward-looking statements in this presentation. DHC’s filings with the SEC are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. You should not place undue reliance upon DHC’s
forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, DHC does not intend to update or change any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Medical Office Market Tailwinds
Medical office fundamentals support sector
growth opportunity
• Growing demand for healthcare services and
increased spending, driven by an aging population
and advancements in care provided.
• Ongoing migration towards outpatient care is
expected to drive demand for outpatient facilities.
• Utilization data shows outpatient visits per 1,000
grew 31% from 2000 to 2023, whereas hospital
inpatient admissions per 1,000 declined 19%. The
shift towards outpatient is linked to multiple factors:
• Consumer preference for greater convenience.
• Lower costs for providers and insurers.
• Advances in clinical science, medical protocols
and technology are enabling more procedures
to be performed at outpatient facilities, instead
of acute care hospitals.
• Limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals.
• Construction cost increases over the last 5 years
have limited new supply despite strong ongoing
demand from health systems.
(1) Data per 1,000 people (population).
Sources: Statista, CMS and Grandview Research, KFF ‘Key Facts About Hospitals’ published February 2025.
DHC’s diversified Medical Office Portfolio of predominantly outpatient facilities is well positioned to
capitalize on growth opportunities in the sector and deliver value to investors.

Management aligned with shareholder interests
RMR base management fee tied to DHC share price performance
• Consists of an annual fee based on 50 bps of the lower of: (1) DHC’s
historical cost of real estate, or (2) DHC’s total market capitalization.
• There is no incentive for RMR to complete any transaction that could
reduce DHC’s share price.
RMR incentive fees are contingent on total shareholder return
outperformance
• Equal to 12% of value generated by DHC in excess of the benchmark
index total returns (MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care REIT Index) per share
over a three-year period, subject to a cap (1.5% of equity market cap).
• Outperformance must be positive: it can’t be the best of the worst.
• Shareholders keep 100% of benchmark returns and at least 88% of
returns in excess of the benchmark.
Other fees
• Property management fee: consists of an annual fee based on 3.0% of
rents collected at DHC’s medical office, life science and active adult
properties.
• Construction supervision fee based on project costs.
Alignment of Interests
If DHC’s total market cap exceeds historical cost of
real estate, base fee is paid on assets.
If DHC’s total market cap is less than historical cost
of real estate, base fee fluctuates with share price.
Incentive fee structure keeps RMR focused on
increasing total shareholder return.
Members of RMR senior management are holders of
DHC shares, some subject to long term lock up
agreements.
DHC shareholders have visibility into publicly traded
RMR.
DHC benefits from RMR’s national footprint and
economies of scale of a $40 billionplatform.

NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI
The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to
our property level results of operations. We calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI as shown in this appendix. We define NOI as income from our real estate
less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization. We define Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease
termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses. We calculate same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI in the same manner that we calculate the
corresponding NOI and cash basis NOI amounts, except that we only include same properties in calculating same property NOI and same property cash basis NOI. We use NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same
property NOI and same property cash basis NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same
property NOI and same property cash basis NOI differently than we do.
FFO and Normalized FFO
We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown in this appendix. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income (loss), calculated
in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if
any, and including adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of FFO of our equity method investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other
adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items shown in this appendix, including similar adjustments for our unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and
include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not
necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining
such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our
shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing our debt, the availability to us of debt
and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies
and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We present certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same
property NOI, same property Cash Basis NOI, funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, and cash available for distribution, or CAD. These measures do
not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of
our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated statements of income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be
appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects
of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash
Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and
management to understand the operations of our properties.
DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Cash Available for Distribution
We calculate CAD as shown on page 38. We define CAD as Normalized FFO minus our proportionate share of Normalized FFO from unconsolidated joint venture properties and our equity method
investment, plus operating cash flow distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures and equity method investment, if any, recurring real estate related capital expenditures, adjustments for
other non-cash and nonrecurring items, certain amounts excluded from Normalized FFO but settled in cash, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. CAD is among the factors
considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate CAD differently than we do.
