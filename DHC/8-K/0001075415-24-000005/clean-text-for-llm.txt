Q4 2023 3 "DHC’s fourth quarter 2023 was highlighted by improvements in our  SHOP and Office Portfolio segments.  SHOP occupancy increased 300  basis points year-over-year to 79.3% and average monthly rates  increased by 5.5%, resulting in a 9.9% increase in SHOP revenues. In  our Office Portfolio, we realized sequential and year-over-year  increases in same property cash basis NOI. In addition, we achieved an  18.1% increase in weighted average rents on 200,444 square feet of  leasing in the quarter that we expect to benefit us in the future. During the quarter, we issued $940.5 million of zero coupon secured  notes with a January 2026 maturity date and a one-year extension  option. We used the net proceeds to repay and terminate our $450  million secured credit facility and redeem $250 million of our senior  notes that were scheduled to mature in May 2024. These actions  allowed us to immediately regain compliance with our debt covenants  and we ended the quarter well positioned to continue funding  necessary capital to drive the growth and recovery of our senior living  communities."

Q4 2023 29 The Company: DHC is a REIT focused on owning high-quality healthcare properties located  throughout the United States. DHC seeks diversification across the health services  spectrum by care delivery and practice type, by scientific research disciplines and by  property type and location. As of December 31, 2023, DHC’s approximately $7.2  billion portfolio included 371 properties in 36 states and Washington, D.C., occupied  by approximately 500 tenants, and totaling approximately 8.6 million square feet of  life science and medical office properties and more than 27,000 senior living units. DHC is included in 120 market indices and comprises more than 1% of the following  indices as of December 31, 2023: BI North America Healthcare REIT Valuation Peers  (BIHLCRNP), Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Mid Cap Index (BBREMIDC),  Invesco S&P SmallCap 600 Pure Value ETF INAV Index (RZVIV), Invesco FTSE RAFI US  1500 Small-Mid ETF INAV Index (PRFZIV), BI NA Healthcare REIT - Competitive  (BIHLCRNC) and Invesco S&P SmallCap Financials ETF INAV Index (PSCFIV). Management: DHC is managed by The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR). RMR is an alternative asset  management company that is focused on commercial real estate and related  businesses. RMR primarily provides management services to publicly traded real  estate companies, privately held real estate funds and real estate related operating  businesses. As of December 31, 2023, RMR had over $41 billion of real estate assets  under management and the combined RMR managed companies had more than $5  billion of annual revenues, over 2,000 properties and over 20,000 employees. DHC  believes that being managed by RMR is a competitive advantage for DHC because of  RMR’s depth of management and experience in the real estate industry. DHC also  believes RMR provides management services to it at costs that are lower than DHC  would have to pay for similar quality services if DHC were self-managed.

Q4 2023 35 Non-GAAP Financial Measures DHC presents certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same property Cash Basis NOI,  earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or  Normalized FFO. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of DHC's operating  performance or as measures of DHC's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in DHC's consolidated statements of income (loss). DHC considers these non- GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). DHC believes these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding  the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of DHC's operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash  Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to  understand the operations of DHC's properties. NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's  property level results of operations. DHC calculates NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI as shown on pages 31 and 32. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its  property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that DHC records as depreciation and amortization. DHC defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI  excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fee amortization, if any, and non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses. DHC calculates same property  NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner that it calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI amounts, except that it only includes same properties in calculating same property NOI and  same property Cash Basis NOI. DHC uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance. Other real estate companies  and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI differently than DHC does. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre DHC calculates EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 33. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA,  excluding gains or losses on the sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, impairment of assets, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of  EBITDAre of DHC's former equity method investment in AlerisLife for the periods DHC had an equity investment in AlerisLife that it accounted for as an equity method investment and DHC's proportionate share of  EBITDAre from its unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 33. Other real estate  companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre differently than DHC does. FFO and Normalized FFO DHC calculates FFO and Normalized FFO as shown on page 34. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of  properties, equity in net earnings or losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's  proportionate share of FFO of DHC's former equity method investment in AlerisLife for the periods DHC had an equity investment in AlerisLife that it accounted for as an equity method investment and DHC's  proportionate share of FFO from its unconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In  calculating Normalized FFO, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 34, including similar adjustments for DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures, if any. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by  DHC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to its shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain DHC's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in  the agreements governing DHC's debt, the availability to DHC of debt and equity capital, DHC's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance, and DHC's expected needs for and availability  of cash to pay its obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than DHC does. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q4 2023 36 Adjusted total assets Adjusted total assets is the original cost of real estate assets calculated in accordance with GAAP before depreciation and after impairment write downs, if any, and excludes  accounts receivable and intangible assets.

Annualized dividend yield Annualized dividend yield is the annualized dividend declared during the applicable period divided by the closing price of DHC's common shares on The Nasdaq Stock  Market LLC, or Nasdaq, at the end of the relevant period. Annualized rental income Annualized rental income is based on rents pursuant to existing leases as of December 31, 2023. Annualized rental income includes estimated percentage rents, straight  line rent adjustments and estimated recurring expense reimbursements for certain net and modified gross leases, and excludes lease value amortization. Amounts of annualized rental income for  DHC's medical office and life science properties also exclude 100% of rents pursuant to existing leases as of December 31, 2023 from the medical office and life science properties owned by  unconsolidated joint ventures in which DHC owns an equity interest.  Average monthly rate Average monthly rate is calculated by taking the average daily rate, which is defined as total residents fees and services divided by occupied units during the period, and  multiplying it by 30 days. Building improvements Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components that extend the useful life of existing assets or other improvements to  increase the marketability of the property. Cash basis NOI margin % Cash basis NOI margin % is defined as cash basis NOI as a percentage of cash basis rental income. Cash basis rental income excludes non-cash straight line rent  adjustments, lease value amortization and lease termination fee amortization, if any.

Coupon rate Coupon rate is the interest rate stated in, or determined pursuant to, the contract terms. Development, redevelopment and other activities Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditures that reposition a property or result in new sources of  revenue. From time to time DHC invests in revenue producing capital improvements at certain of its triple net leased senior living communities. As a result, annual rents payable to DHC increase  pursuant to the terms of the applicable leases. These capital improvements are not included in DHC's development, redevelopment and other activities. Estimated completion date Estimated completion date can depend on various factors, including when lease agreements are signed with tenants in DHC's Office Portfolio. Therefore, the actual  completion date may vary. Estimated project costs Estimated project costs include estimated construction costs and leasing capital up to stabilization. Five Star Five Star, or Five Star Senior Living, is an operating division of AlerisLife. Five Star managed communities Five Star managed communities are the senior living communities in DHC's SHOP segment that are managed by Five Star.

Gross purchase price Gross purchase price includes assumed debt, if any, and excludes acquisition costs and purchase price allocation adjustments, if any. Gross sales price Gross sales price excludes closing costs. Incurrence covenants Incurrence covenants are financial covenants which DHC is required to comply with in order to incur debt under its senior secured and unsecured notes indentures and their  supplements. Interest rate Interest rate includes the effect of mark to market accounting for certain assumed mortgages and premiums and discounts on certain mortgages and secured and unsecured notes;  excludes effects of debt issuance costs. Investment per square foot or unit Investment per square foot or unit represents gross book value of real estate assets divided by number of rentable square feet or living units, as applicable, at  December 31, 2023. Lease related costs Lease related costs generally include capital expenditures to improve tenants’ space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space and leasing related costs, such as  brokerage commissions and tenant inducements. Leasing costs and concession commitments Leasing costs and concession commitments include commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements,  leasing commissions, tenant reimbursements and free rent. Maintenance covenant DHC's maintenance covenant is a financial covenant which it is required to comply with on a quarterly basis pursuant to the indentures governing DHC's senior secured and  unsecured notes. Net debt Net debt is total debt less cash.  NOI margin % NOI margin % is defined as NOI as a percentage of rental income or residents fees and services, as appropriate.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions (continued) RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q4 2023 38 Office Portfolio Office Portfolio consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties leased to biotech laboratories  and other similar tenants. DHC's medical office and life science property leases include some triple net leases where, in addition to paying fixed rents, the tenants assume the obligation to operate and  maintain the properties at their expense, and some net and modified gross leases where DHC is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the properties and DHC charges tenants for some or  all of the property operating costs. A small percentage of DHC's medical office and life science property leases are full-service leases where DHC receives fixed rent from its tenants and no  reimbursement for its property operating costs. Other operator managed communities Other operator managed communities are senior living communities in DHC's SHOP segment, which are managed by third party managers other than Five  Star. Principal balance Principal balances are the amounts stated in the contracts less the principal amount of any repayments made. In accordance with GAAP, DHC's carrying values and recorded interest  expense may be different because of market conditions at the time DHC assumed certain of these debts.
