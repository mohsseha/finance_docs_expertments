Q2 2024 3 "In the second quarter, DHC exceeded expectations for  normalized FFO due to revenue growth and expense  management. These results were supported by a 27% year  over year increase in SHOP same property NOI and  occupancy and rent growths. Within our Medical Office and  Life Science Portfolio, we achieved a 12% increase in  weighted average rental rates on over 100,000 square feet  of leasing, which marks our fourth consecutive quarter of  double digit rent growth. With continued favorable SHOP industry trends, we are well  positioned to execute on our priorities for the remainder of  the year. We remain focused on achieving our SHOP NOI  growth target for 2024, as well as strengthening our capital  and liquidity profile."

DHC seeks diversification across the health services  spectrum by care delivery and practice type, by scientific research disciplines and by  property type and location. As of June 30, 2024, DHC’s approximately $7.2 billion  portfolio included 370 properties in 36 states and Washington, D.C., occupied by  approximately 500 tenants, and totaling approximately 8.4 million square feet of life  science and medical office properties and more than 27,000 senior living units. DHC is included in 122 market indices and comprises more than 1% of the following  indices as of June 30, 2024: BI North America Healthcare REIT Valuation Peers  (BIHLCRNP), Bloomberg Real Estate Investment Trust Mid Cap Index (BBREMIDC),  Invesco FTSE RAFI US 1500 Small-Mid ETF INAV Index (PRFZIV), BI NA Healthcare REIT  - Competitive (BIHLCRNC) and Invesco S&P SmallCap Financials ETF INAV Index  (PSCFIV). Management: DHC is managed by The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR). RMR is an alternative asset  management company that is focused on commercial real estate and related  businesses. RMR primarily provides management services to publicly traded real  estate companies, privately held real estate funds and real estate related operating  businesses. As of June 30, 2024, RMR had over $41 billion of real estate assets under  management and the combined RMR managed companies had more than $5 billion  of annual revenues, approximately 2,000 properties and over 20,000 employees. DHC  believes that being managed by RMR is a competitive advantage for DHC because of  RMR’s depth of management and experience in the real estate industry. DHC also  believes RMR provides management services to it at costs that are lower than DHC  would have to pay for similar quality services if DHC were self-managed.

Q2 2024 38 Non-GAAP Financial Measures DHC presents certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same property Cash Basis NOI, earnings before  interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO. These measures  do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of DHC's operating performance or as measures of DHC's liquidity.  These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in DHC's condensed consolidated statements of income (loss). DHC considers these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental  measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). DHC believes these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation  and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of DHC's operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting  only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of DHC's properties. NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's property level  results of operations. DHC calculates NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI as shown on pages 33 and 34. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its property operating expenses.  NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that DHC records as depreciation and amortization. DHC defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent  adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses. DHC calculates same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner  that it calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI amounts, except that it only includes same properties in calculating same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI. DHC uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property  NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash  Basis NOI differently than DHC does. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre DHC calculates EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 35. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA, excluding gains  or losses on the sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, impairment of real estate assets, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of EBITDAre of DHC's equity method investees,  as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 35 and includes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter  versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of DHC's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such  business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre and  Adjusted EBITDAre differently than DHC does. FFO and Normalized FFO DHC calculates FFO and Normalized FFO as shown on page 36. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties,  equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of FFO of DHC's equity method  investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Normalized FFO, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 36,  including similar adjustments for DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in  accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of DHC's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all  contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by DHC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to its  shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain DHC's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing DHC's debt, the availability to DHC of debt and equity capital,  DHC's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance and DHC's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and  Normalized FFO differently than DHC does. Cash Available for Distribution DHC calculates cash available for distribution, or CAD, as shown on page 37. DHC defines CAD as Normalized FFO minus DHC's proportionate share of Normalized FFO from unconsolidated joint venture properties and its equity  method investment, plus operating cash flow distributions received from DHC's unconsolidated joint venture and equity method investment, if any, recurring real estate related capital expenditures, adjustments for other non-cash  and nonrecurring items, certain amounts excluded from Normalized FFO but settled in cash, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. CAD is among the factors considered by DHC's Board of Trustees  when determining the amount of distributions to DHC's shareholders. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate CAD differently than DHC does. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
