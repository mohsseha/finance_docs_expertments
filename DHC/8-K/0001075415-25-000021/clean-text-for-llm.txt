Q1 2025 3 "During the first quarter, we made substantial progress in growing  SHOP NOI, which increased 47.7% and 49.0% on a sequential  quarter and year over year basis, respectively, to $37 million. This  was achieved primarily through rate increases, along with a 330- basis point increase in NOI margin compared to last quarter. We  believe that our operating results are reflective of our active asset  management and the capital we have deployed to upgrade our  SHOP communities. We have also made meaningful progress in addressing our 2025  and 2026 debt maturities. In March and April, we completed two  debt financings totaling $249 million in aggregate proceeds. These  completed financings, together with an expected $94 million in  proceeds from additional debt financings, which we expect to close  by the end of May 2025, and cash on hand, will provide us with  ample liquidity to extinguish our 2025 debt maturities. Also during  the first quarter, we sold 22 properties securing our senior notes  due in 2026 for $299 million in net proceeds which we used to  reduce the $940.5 million outstanding balance of these notes. Given  the execution of these financings and asset sales, and our planned  future financings and asset sales, we remain confident in our ability  to address our 2026 debt maturities."

Q1 2025 30 The Company: DHC is a REIT focused on owning high-quality healthcare properties located  throughout the United States. DHC seeks diversification across the health services  spectrum by care delivery and practice type, by scientific research disciplines and by  property type and location. As of March 31, 2025, DHC’s approximately $6.8 billion  portfolio included 343 properties in 34 states and Washington, D.C., with more than  26,000 senior living units, approximately 7.6 million square feet of medical office and  life science properties and occupied by approximately 450 tenants. Management: DHC is managed by The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR). RMR is an alternative asset  management company that is focused on commercial real estate and related  businesses. RMR primarily provides management services to publicly traded real  estate companies, privately held real estate funds and real estate related operating  businesses. As of March 31, 2025, RMR had approximately $40 billion of real estate  assets under management and the combined RMR managed companies had more  than $5 billion of annual revenues, approximately 1,900 properties and over 18,000  employees. DHC believes that being managed by RMR is a competitive advantage for  DHC because of RMR’s depth of management and experience in the real estate  industry. DHC also believes RMR provides management services to it at costs that are  lower than DHC would have to pay for similar quality services if DHC were self- managed.

Q1 2025 37 Non-GAAP Financial Measures DHC presents certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including net operating income, or NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI, same  property Cash Basis NOI, earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, funds from operations, or FFO, normalized funds from operations,  or Normalized FFO, and cash available for distribution, or CAD. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as  indicators of DHC's operating performance or as measures of DHC's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in DHC's condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).  DHC considers these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). DHC believes these measures provide useful information to investors because  by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of DHC's operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, Cash  Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the  operations of DHC's properties. NOI, Cash Basis NOI, Same Property NOI and Same Property Cash Basis NOI The calculations of NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's property level  results of operations. DHC calculates NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI as shown on pages 32 and 33. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its property operating expenses.  NOI excludes depreciation and amortization. DHC defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization included in  property operating expenses. DHC calculates same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI in the same manner that it calculates the corresponding NOI and Cash Basis NOI amounts, except that it only includes same  properties in calculating same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI. DHC uses NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level  performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI, Cash Basis NOI, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI differently than DHC does. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre DHC calculates EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as shown on page 34. EBITDAre is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is EBITDA, excluding gains  or losses on the sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, impairment of real estate assets, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of EBITDAre of DHC's equity method investees,  as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 34. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA, EBITDAre and  Adjusted EBITDAre differently than DHC does. FFO and Normalized FFO DHC calculates FFO and Normalized FFO as shown on page 35. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties,  equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect DHC's proportionate share of FFO of DHC's equity method  investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. In calculating Normalized FFO, DHC adjusts for the items shown on page 35,  including similar adjustments for DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and incentive management fees, if any. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by DHC's Board of Trustees when determining the  amount of distributions to its shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain DHC's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing DHC's debt, the availability to DHC  of debt and equity capital, DHC's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance and DHC's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may  calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than DHC does. Cash Available for Distribution DHC calculates CAD as shown on page 36. DHC defines CAD as Normalized FFO minus DHC's proportionate share of Normalized FFO from unconsolidated joint venture properties and its equity method investment, plus operating  cash flow distributions received from DHC's unconsolidated joint ventures and equity method investment, if any, recurring real estate related capital expenditures, adjustments for other non-cash and nonrecurring items, certain  amounts excluded from Normalized FFO but settled in cash, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to DHC. CAD is among the factors considered by DHC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of  distributions to DHC's shareholders. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate CAD differently than DHC does. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions RETURN TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q1 2025 38 Adjusted total assets Adjusted total assets is the original cost of real estate assets calculated in accordance with GAAP before depreciation and after impairment write downs, if any, and excludes  accounts receivable and intangible assets. AlerisLife AlerisLife means AlerisLife Inc. All Other All Other operations consists of triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators from which DHC receives rents, and any other  revenue or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reportable segment. Annualized dividend yield Annualized dividend yield is the annualized dividend declared during the applicable period divided by the closing price of DHC's common shares at the end of the  relevant period. Annualized rental income Annualized rental income is based on rents pursuant to existing leases as of March 31, 2025.
