DIVERSIFIED HEALTHCARE TRUST
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
Note 1.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Diversified Healthcare Trust and its subsidiaries, or we, us, or our, are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, or our Annual Report.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included. All intercompany transactions and balances with or among our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairments of real estate and intangible assets.
We have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be involved in claims, lawsuits, and regulatory and other governmental audits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, some of which may involve material amounts. Also, the defense and resolution of these claims, lawsuits, and regulatory and other governmental audits, investigations and proceedings may require us to incur significant expense. We account for claims and litigation losses in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450,
Contingencies
, or ASC 450. Under ASC 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable and estimable losses at our best estimate of a loss or, when a best estimate cannot be made, at our estimate of the minimum loss. These estimates are often developed prior to knowing the amount of the ultimate loss, require the application of considerable judgment, and are refined as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, we are often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the estimated minimum loss amount, which could be zero, is recorded; and then, as information becomes known, the minimum loss amount is updated, as appropriate. A minimum or best estimate amount may be increased or decreased when events result in a changed expectation.
Going Concern
The senior living industry has been adversely affected by a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as economic and market conditions. These conditions continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Although there have been signs of recovery and increased demand when compared to the low levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, the recovery of our senior housing operating portfolio, or SHOP, segment has been slower than previously anticipated and uneven, and we cannot be sure when or if the senior living business will return to historic pre-pandemic levels. To mitigate the effects of the slow recovery coming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased variability in operating cash flows from our SHOP communities, we continue to work with our senior living operators to manage costs, especially labor costs, and to increase rates and occupancy. However, increased operating costs resulting from difficult labor market conditions, wage and commodity price inflation and increased insurance costs, among other things, continue to negatively impact margins. Additionally, while our senior living operators have increased rates, those rates are increasing gradually and are not increasing at the same pace as our costs, putting further pressure on our margins. In order to increase the probability of a recovery of our cash flows, we have continued to invest capital in our SHOP segment, which has reduced our cash balances since the filing of our Annual Report on March 1, 2023. As a result of our decreased cash balances, we have deferred, and may continue to defer, future capital expenditures to preserve liquidity, which may slow the pace of any recovery of our cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service was below the
1.5
x incurrence requirement under our credit agreement and our public debt covenants, and we cannot be certain how long this ratio will remain below
1.5
x. We are unable to refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt until this ratio is at or above
1.5
x on a pro forma basis. As of September 30, 2023, we had $
278,122
of cash and cash equivalents and $
700,000
of outstanding debt due within one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements, including $
450,000
in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, which matures on January 15, 2024, and $
250,000
of senior notes that mature

(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
on May 1, 2024. Our credit facility is secured by
62
properties which had an appraised value of approximately $
1,114,270
based on appraisals completed in 2023.
Based on the challenges described above, as well as our reduced cash balances, additional capital commitments in both our Office Portfolio and SHOP segments and upcoming debt maturities, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. In September 2023, subsequent to the termination of our proposed merger with Office Properties Income Trust, or OPI, we engaged B. Riley Securities, Inc., or B. Riley, as a financial advisor to help us evaluate our options to address our near term capital needs, including the upcoming debt maturities described above. Among the alternatives being considered to address our near term capital needs are raising permissible new capital, including by selling assets, as well as seeking an extension of the maturity date of our credit facility. Regarding any new capital that may be raised, we are limited in the type of financings we can pursue as we cannot currently refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt, as described above. We are also engaging in discussions with the lenders under our $
450,000
credit facility regarding an amendment to our credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the facility, amend certain covenants and allow us to repay maturing debt, among other things. While we believe that the new capital we expect to raise, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, and the possible extension of the maturity date of our credit facility, will alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we cannot provide assurance that we will raise new capital or sell assets or that any new capital raised, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, will be sufficient to repay our maturing debt or that our lenders will agree to an extension of the maturity date of our credit facility. Due to challenging capital market conditions, in particular with respect to commercial real estate, we do not believe that it is probable, as of the date of issuance of these financial statements, that we will raise sufficient new capital, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, to meet our upcoming contractual commitments. As of November 1, 2023, we cannot demonstrate that our management's plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern will be probable in mitigating the conditions that raise the substantial doubt because our plan to raise permissible new capital, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, and to extend the maturity date of our credit facility, is subject to market conditions and lender approvals, among other things, which are beyond our control.
Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Termination of Merger Agreement with Office Properties Income Trust
On April 11, 2023, we and OPI entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which we and OPI agreed that we would merge with and into OPI, with OPI as the surviving entity in the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. On September 1, 2023, we and OPI mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement and entered into a termination agreement, or the Termination Agreement. The mutual termination of the Merger Agreement was separately recommended by special committees of our and OPI’s respective board of trustees and approved by our and OPI’s respective board of trustees.
Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the termination of the Merger Agreement was effective as of September 1, 2023. Neither we nor OPI are required to pay any termination fee as a result of the mutual decision to terminate the Merger Agreement. We and OPI will bear our and its respective costs and expenses related to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Following the deconsolidation in December 2021 of the net assets of an unconsolidated joint venture that owns a life science property located in Boston, Massachusetts, or the Seaport JV, we no longer include this $
620,000
of secured debt financing in our condensed consolidated balance sheet; however, we continue to provide certain guaranties on this debt.
(3)
The debt securing these properties is non-recourse to us.

The maturity date of February 9, 2024 is subject to
three
,
one year
extension options and requires interest to be paid at an annual rate based on the secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR, plus a premium of
1.90
%. The interest rate is as of September 30, 2023. This joint venture has also purchased an interest rate cap through February 2024 with a SOFR strike rate equal to
4.00
%.
In December 2021, we sold an additional
35
% equity interest from our then remaining
55
% equity interest in the Seaport JV to another third party institutional investor for $
378,000
, before closing costs and other adjustments. Effective as of the date of the sale, we deconsolidated this joint venture and we now account for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting under the fair value option. In June 2022, we sold an additional
10
% equity interest from our then remaining
20
% equity interest in the Seaport JV to an existing joint venture investor for $
108,000
, before closing costs and other adjustments. We recognized a net loss on sale of $
1,226
related to this transaction during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which is included in (loss) gain on sale of properties in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). After giving effect to these sales, we continue to own a
10
% equity interest in this joint venture. Our initial investment amount was based on a property valuation of $
1,700,000
, less $
620,000
of existing mortgage debts on the property that this joint venture assumed. See Note 5 for more information regarding the valuation of our investment in this joint venture.
In January 2022, we entered into a joint venture with
two
unrelated third party institutional investors for
10
medical office and life science properties we owned, or the LSMD JV. We sold equity interests in this joint venture to those investors for aggregate proceeds, before closing costs and other adjustments, of approximately $
653,300
. We deconsolidated the net assets of these properties effective as of the date of the sale and recognized a net gain on sale of $
322,468
related to this transaction during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which is included in (loss) gain on sale of properties in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The equity interests that the investors acquired from us equaled
41
% and
39
%, respectively, of the total equity interests in the joint venture and we retained a
20
% equity interest in the joint venture. Following the sale, we account for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting under the fair value option. The initial investment amounts were based upon a property valuation of approximately $
702,500
, less approximately $
456,600
of secured debt on the properties incurred by this joint venture. See Note 5 for more information regarding the valuation of our investment in this joint venture.

, excluding closing costs.
As of October 27, 2023, we had
one
property under an agreement to sell for a sales price of approximately $
1,800
, excluding closing costs. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result.
Impairment:
We regularly evaluate our assets for indicators of impairment. Impairment indicators may include declining tenant or resident occupancy, weak or declining profitability from the property, decreasing tenant cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life, and legislative, market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of an asset. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the affected assets by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from those assets. The future cash flows are subjective and are based in part on assumptions regarding hold periods, market rents and terminal capitalization rates. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $
14,763
related to
four
life science and medical office properties and
one
senior living community that were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2023. We also recorded impairment charges of $
3,617
to adjust the carrying value of
one
senior living community to its estimated fair value.

Note 3.
Leases
We are a lessor of medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties. Our leases provide our tenants with the contractual right to use and economically benefit from all of the premises demised under the leases; therefore, we have determined to evaluate our leases as lease arrangements.
Our leases provide for base rent payments and, in addition, may include variable payments. Rental income from operating leases, including any payments derived by index or market based indices, is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term when we have determined that the collectability of substantially all of the lease payments is probable. Some of our leases have options to extend or terminate the lease exercisable at the option of our tenants, which are considered when determining the lease term.
We increased rental income to record revenue on a straight line basis by $
676
and $
2,738
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $
7,193
for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. We decreased rental income to record revenue on a straight line basis by $
1,333
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Rents receivable, excluding receivables related to our properties classified as held for sale, if any, include $
74,884
and $
76,363
of straight line rent receivables at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in other assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We do not include in our measurement of our lease receivables certain variable payments, including changes in the index or market based indices after the inception of the lease, certain tenant reimbursements and other income until the specific events that trigger the variable payments have occurred. Such payments totaled $
12,018
and $
11,312
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which tenant reimbursements totaled $
11,965
and $
11,263
, respectively, and $
36,579
and $
32,450
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which tenant reimbursements totaled $
36,414
and $
32,276
, respectively.
Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability:
For leases where we are the lessee, we recognized a right of use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments with rental payments being applied to the lease liability and the right of use asset being amortized over the term of the lease. The values of the right of use assets and related liabilities representing our future obligation under the respective lease arrangements for which we are the lessee were $
24,163
and $
24,545
, respectively, as of September 30, 2023, and $
26,508
and $
26,889
, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The right of use assets and related lease liabilities are included within
other assets, net
and
other liabilities
, respectively, within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we lease equipment at certain of our managed senior living communities. These leases are short term in nature, are cancelable with no fee or do not result in an annual expense in excess of our capitalization policy and, as a result, are not recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Note 4.
Indebtedness
Our principal debt obligations, excluding any debt obligations of our joint ventures, at September 30, 2023 were: (1) $
450,000
of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility; (2) $
2,350,000
outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured notes; and (3) $
9,504
principal amount of a mortgage note secured by
one
property. This mortgaged property had a net book value of $
12,962
at September 30, 2023. We also had
two
properties subject to finance leases that expire in 2026 with lease obligations totaling $
4,156
at September 30, 2023; these
two
properties had a net book value of $
23,140
and $
22,347
at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
We have a $
450,000
credit facility that is used for general business purposes and matures in January 2024. We are required to pay interest on the amount outstanding under our credit facility at a rate of SOFR plus a premium, which was
290
basis points per annum at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, our credit facility required interest to be paid on borrowings at the annual rate of
8.3
%, plus a facility fee of $
338
per quarter. The weighted average annual interest rates for borrowings under our credit facility were
8.3
% and
4.8
% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and
7.8
% and
3.8
% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and October 27, 2023, we were fully drawn under our credit facility. We are also engaging in discussions with the lenders under our $
450,000
credit facility regarding an amendment to our credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the facility, amend certain covenants and allow us to repay maturing debt, among other things.

As of September 30, 2023, all $
500,000
of our
9.75
% senior notes due 2025 and all $
500,000
of our
4.375
% senior notes due 2031 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis and on a senior unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries, except for certain excluded subsidiaries, including pledged subsidiaries under our credit agreement. The notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining $
1,350,000
of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees as of September 30, 2023.
In January 2023, pursuant to our credit agreement, we repaid $
113,627
in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the facility commitments were reduced to $
586,373
.
In February 2023, we and our lenders further amended our credit agreement. Pursuant to the amendment:
•
the waiver of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant has been extended through the maturity date of our credit facility, or January 15, 2024;
•
the minimum liquidity requirement was decreased from $
200,000
to $
100,000
;
•
the facility commitments were reduced from $
586,373
to $
450,000
following our repayment of $
136,373
in then outstanding borrowings, and as a result of the reduction in commitments, we recorded a loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt of $
1,075
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023;
•
the feature of our credit facility permitting us to reborrow any repaid funds was eliminated;
•
we continue to have the ability to fund $
400,000
of capital expenditures per year and we are restricted in our ability to acquire real property as defined in the credit agreement;
•
SOFR was established as the replacement benchmark rate in place of LIBOR to calculate interest payable on amounts outstanding under our credit facility, and the interest premium under our credit facility was increased by
40
basis points; and
•
we are required to repay outstanding amounts under our credit facility with excess cash flow, and certain financial covenants and restrictions on distributions to common shareholders, share repurchases, capital expenditures, acquiring additional properties and incurring additional indebtedness (in each case subject to various exceptions) will remain in place through the maturity date of our credit facility.
Pursuant to our credit agreement, we pledged certain equity interests of subsidiaries owning properties to secure our obligations under our credit agreement and have provided first mortgage liens on
62
medical office and life science properties with an aggregate net book value of $
826,780
as of September 30, 2023 to secure our obligations, which pledges and/or mortgage liens may be removed or new ones may be added based on outstanding debt amounts, among other things.
Our credit agreement requires us to maintain collateral properties with an aggregate appraised value of at least $
1,090,909
, and allows Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent under our credit facility, or the Administrative Agent, to periodically reappraise the collateral properties. On June 23, 2023, the Administrative Agent notified us that the reappraised value of the then
61
medical office and life science properties securing our credit facility since September 2021 had declined from $
1,337,200
to $
1,046,770
, below the $
1,090,909
threshold required under our credit agreement. Failure to meet the required threshold constitutes a non-monetary event of default under our credit agreement. In July 2023, we obtained a limited waiver from the Administrative Agent and requisite lenders under our credit facility, which waived the event of default and decreased the required appraised value of the collateral properties through September 30, 2023. In September 2023, we pledged the equity interests of an additional subsidiary owning
one
medical office property to secure our obligations under our credit agreement and provided a first mortgage lien on such medical office property. As of September 30, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with this covenant.
In April 2023, we prepaid a mortgage note secured by one of our senior living communities with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $
14,565
, a maturity date in June 2023 and an annual interest rate of
6.64
% using cash on hand.

(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
Our credit agreement and our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, as defined, which includes The RMR Group LLC, or RMR, ceasing to act as our business and property manager. Our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements and our credit agreement also contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts and require us to maintain various financial ratios, and our credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in certain circumstances. As of September 30, 2023, our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service was below the
1.5
x incurrence requirement under our credit agreement and our public debt covenants as the effects of the slower than anticipated and uneven recovery of our SHOP business from the COVID-19 pandemic, wage and commodity price inflation, rising interest rates, increased insurance costs, geopolitical risks and other economic, market and industry conditions continued to adversely impact our operations. We are unable to refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt until this ratio is at or above
1.5
x on a pro forma basis. As of September 30, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with all of the other covenants under our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements, our credit agreement and our other debt obligations, subject to the waivers described above. Although we continue to take steps to enhance our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, a protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage or commodity price inflation, rising or sustained high interest rates, increased insurance costs, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed and uneven recovery of the senior housing industry, downturns or recessions, may cause increased pressure on our ability to satisfy financial and other covenants. If our operating results and financial condition are significantly negatively impacted by economic conditions or otherwise, we may fail to satisfy covenants and conditions under our credit agreement or fail to satisfy our public debt covenants. In addition, we may be unable to repay the $
450,000
in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility if we do not succeed in realizing our plan to address the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern or if that plan is not successful. Further, if we believe we will not be able to satisfy our financial or other covenants, we expect that we would seek waivers or amendments prior to any covenant violation or seek other financing alternatives. Any such waiver or amendment may result in increased costs and interest rates, additional restrictive covenants or other lender protections imposed on us. For example, we are currently engaging in discussions with the lenders under our credit facility regarding a possible extension and amendment of that facility, as described above.

On February 2, 2023, in connection with the proposed acquisition of AlerisLife Inc., or AlerisLife, by a subsidiary of ABP Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of The RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc., we agreed to tender all of the
10,691,658
shares of common stock of AlerisLife, we owned at a price of $
1.31
per share, and the acquisition was completed on March 20, 2023. Prior to March 20, 2023, these AlerisLife common shares were included in other assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, and were reported at fair value, which was based upon quoted market prices on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, (Level 1 inputs). During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded an unrealized loss of $
2,674
, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded an unrealized gain of $
8,126
and an unrealized loss of $
21,384
, respectively, which are included in gains and losses on equity securities, net in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), to adjust the carrying value of our former investment in AlerisLife common shares to their fair value. See Note 10 for further information about our investment in AlerisLife.

We have assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of $
427
to reduce the carrying value of
one
life science property that is classified as held for sale to its estimated sales price, less estimated costs to sell, of $
5,845
under an agreement to sell that we have entered into with a third party. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we also recorded impairment charges of $
729
to reduce the carrying value of
one
senior living community that is classified as held for sale to its estimated sales price, less estimated costs to sell, of $
741
under an agreement to sell that we have entered into with a third party. See Note 2 for further information about impairment charges and the properties we have classified as held for sale.
In addition to the assets described in the table above, our financial instruments at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 included cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, certain other assets, our credit facility, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and finance leases and certain other unsecured obligations and liabilities.

We assumed certain of these secured debts in connection with our acquisition of certain properties. We recorded the assumed mortgage notes at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and we are amortizing the fair value adjustments, if any, to interest expense over the respective terms of the mortgage notes to adjust interest expense to the estimated market interest rates as of the date of acquisition.
We estimated the fair values of our
two
issuances of senior unsecured notes due 2042 and 2046 based on the closing price on Nasdaq (Level 1 inputs) as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. We estimated the fair values of our
four
issuances of senior unsecured notes due 2024, 2025, 2028 and 2031 using an average of the bid and ask price on Nasdaq on or about September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). We estimated the fair values of our secured debts by using discounted cash flows analyses and currently prevailing market terms as of the measurement date (Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). Because Level 3 inputs are unobservable, our estimated fair values may differ materially from the actual fair values.

Segment Reporting
We operate in, and report financial information for, the following
two
segments: Office Portfolio and SHOP. We aggregate each of these
two
reporting segments based on their similar operating and economic characteristics. Our Office Portfolio segment consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties leased to biotech laboratories and other similar tenants. Our SHOP segment consists of managed senior living communities that provide short term and long term residential living and, in some instances, care and other services for residents where we pay fees to managers to operate the communities on our behalf.
We also report “non-segment” operations, which consists of triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators from which we receive rents, which we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reporting segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reporting segment.

Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services established a Provider Relief Fund. Subsequently, the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, was enacted. Retention and use of the funds received under the CARES Act and ARPA are subject to certain terms and conditions. The terms and conditions require that the funds be utilized to compensate for lost revenues that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and for eligible costs to prevent, prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not covered by other sources. Further, fund recipients are required to be participating in Medicare at the time of distribution and are subject to certain other terms and conditions, including quarterly reporting requirements. In addition, fund recipients are required to have billed Medicare during 2019 and to continue to provide care after January 31, 2020 for diagnosis, testing or care for individuals with possible or actual COVID-19 cases. Any funds not used in accordance with the terms and conditions must be returned. We recognize income from government grants on a systematic and rational basis over the period in which we recognize the related expenses or loss of revenues for which the grants are intended to compensate when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the applicable terms and conditions of the grant and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. We have received funds related to certain programs under the CARES Act, ARPA and various state programs in which certain of our communities in our SHOP segment are located. We have recognized $
1,581
and $
1,084
with respect to those funds we received as interest and other income in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) with respect to our SHOP segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Senior Living Community Management Agreements
Our managed senior living communities are operated by third parties pursuant to management agreements. Five Star Senior Living, or Five Star, which is an operating division of AlerisLife, manages many of our SHOP communities. Five Star manages these communities pursuant to a master management agreement that we and Five Star are party to. AlerisLife guarantees the payment and performance of each of its applicable subsidiary's obligations under the applicable management agreements.
In February 2022, we closed a senior living community that had previously been managed by Five Star. We are assessing opportunities to redevelop that property. This community was one of the
108
communities that we and Five Star agreed in 2021 to transition to other third party managers or close. As of December 31, 2021, we had transitioned the other
107

Business and Property Management Agreements with RMR
We have
no
employees. The personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR. We have
two
agreements with RMR to provide management services to us: (1) a business management agreement, which relates to our business generally; and (2) a property management agreement, which relates to the property level operations of many of our properties, including our medical office and life science properties, and major renovation or repositioning activities at our senior living communities that we may request RMR to manage from time to time. See Note 10 for further information regarding our relationship, agreements and transactions with RMR.
We recognized net business management fees of $
3,692

The actual amount of annual incentive fees for 2023, if any, will be based on our common share total return as defined in our business management agreement, for the
three-year
period ending December 31, 2023, and will be payable in January 2024. We did not incur any incentive fee payable for the year ended December 31, 2022. We recognize business management and incentive fees in general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

We are generally responsible for all our operating expenses, including certain expenses incurred or arranged by RMR on our behalf. We are generally not responsible for payment of RMR's employment, office or administrative expenses incurred to provide management services to us, except for the employment and related expenses of RMR's employees assigned to work exclusively or partly at our properties, our share of the wages, benefits and other related costs of RMR's centralized accounting personnel, our share of RMR's costs for providing our internal audit function, or as otherwise agreed. Our property level operating expenses are generally incorporated into the rents charged to our tenants, including certain payroll and related costs incurred by RMR. We reimbursed RMR $

termination fee pursuant to each such agreement upon such termination. On September 1, 2023, we and OPI mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement. Since the merger was not consummated, our business and property management agreements with RMR were not terminated and remain in effect.
Management Agreements Between Our Joint Ventures and RMR.
We have
two
separate joint venture arrangements with third party institutional investors, the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV. RMR provides management services to both of these joint ventures. Our joint ventures are not our consolidated subsidiaries and, as a result, we are not obligated to pay management fees to RMR under our management agreements with RMR for the services it provides regarding the joint ventures. We wholly owned the
10
medical office and life science properties included in the LSMD JV until the contribution of these properties to the LSMD JV in January 2022, and we paid management fees to RMR for the management services it provided to us for those properties until the contribution of those properties to the LSMD JV.
Note 10.
Related Person Transactions
We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR, RMR Inc., AlerisLife (including Five Star) and others related to them, including other companies to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services and some of which have trustees, directors or officers who are also our Trustees or officers. RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR. The Chair of our Board and one of our Managing Trustees, Adam D. Portnoy, is the sole trustee, an officer and the controlling shareholder of ABP Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc. and AlerisLife, the chair of the board of directors, a managing director and the president and chief executive officer of RMR Inc., an officer and employee of RMR and, until the acquisition of AlerisLife by ABP Trust on March 20, 2023, the chair of the board of directors and a managing director of AlerisLife, and currently the sole director of AlerisLife. Jennifer F. Francis, our other Managing Trustee and our President and Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer are also officers and employees of RMR. Jennifer B. Clark, our Secretary and former Managing Trustee, also serves as a managing director and the executive vice president, general counsel and secretary of RMR Inc., an officer and employee of RMR, an officer of ABP Trust, secretary of AlerisLife and, until March 20, 2023, a managing director of AlerisLife. Certain of AlerisLife's officers are officers and employees of RMR. Some of our Independent Trustees also serve as independent trustees of other public companies to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services. Mr. Portnoy serves as the chair of the board and as a managing trustee of these companies. Other officers of RMR, including Ms. Clark, serve as managing trustees or officers of certain of these companies. In addition, officers of RMR and RMR Inc. serve as our officers and officers of other companies to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services.
See Note 6 for information relating to awards of our common shares we made in September 2023 to our officers and certain other employees of RMR and our repurchase of common shares from our officers and certain current and former officers and employees of RMR in satisfaction of tax withholding and payment obligations owed in connection with the vesting of awards of our common shares to them. We include amounts recognized as expense for common share awards to our officers and RMR officers and employees in general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
AlerisLife.
Until March 20, 2023, we were AlerisLife's largest stockholder, owning approximately
31.9
% of AlerisLife's outstanding common shares, and ABP Acquisition LLC, or ABP Acquisition, a subsidiary of ABP Trust, together with ABP Trust, owned approximately
6.1
% of AlerisLife's outstanding common shares. Five Star is an operating division of AlerisLife. Five Star manages certain of the senior living communities we own. RMR provides management services to both us and AlerisLife.
On February 2, 2023, AlerisLife entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the ALR Merger Agreement, with ABP Acquisition, and its wholly owned subsidiary, ABP Acquisition 2 LLC, or ABP Acquisition 2. Pursuant to the ALR Merger Agreement, ABP Acquisition 2 commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding AlerisLife common shares (other than the AlerisLife common shares held by ABP Trust, ABP Acquisition or their subsidiaries), at a price of $
1.31
per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes. Following the consummation of the tender offer, on March 20, 2023, ABP Acquisition 2 merged with and into AlerisLife, with AlerisLife as the surviving entity. We refer to the transactions contemplated by the ALR Merger Agreement as the AlerisLife Transaction.
In connection with the ALR Merger Agreement, on February 2, 2023, we entered into a consent agreement with ABP Acquisition 2, ABP Acquisition, ABP Trust and Adam D. Portnoy, or, collectively, the ABP Parties. Pursuant to the consent agreement, we: (1) consented to AlerisLife’s granting of certain exceptions to the ownership restrictions set forth in its charter
21

(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
to the ABP Parties in connection with the AlerisLife Transaction, (2) waived any default under our master management agreement with Five Star arising or resulting from the AlerisLife Transaction, (3) agreed to tender all the AlerisLife common shares that we and our subsidiary owned, into the tender offer at the tender offer price, subject to the right, but not the obligation, to purchase, in a single private transaction, on or before December 31, 2023, a number of shares of common stock of the surviving entity in the AlerisLife Transaction constituting a percentage up to
31.9
% of the then issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the surviving entity based on the tender offer price and otherwise pursuant to a stockholders agreement to be entered into at the time of any such purchase on such terms as are negotiated and mutually agreed by the parties, and (4) agreed to amend our master management agreement with Five Star to eliminate any change of control default or event of default provisions effective upon the consummation of the AlerisLife Transaction.
See Note 8 for further information regarding our relationships, agreements and transactions with AlerisLife (including Five Star) and Note 5 for further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife.
Termination of the Merger Agreement with Office Properties Income Trust.
As described further in Note 1, on September 1, 2023, we and OPI mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement and entered into the Termination Agreement. Neither we nor OPI are required to pay any termination fee as a result of the mutual decision to terminate the Merger Agreement. We and OPI will bear our and its respective costs and expenses related to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Our Joint Ventures.
In connection with our entering into the LSMD JV in January 2022, we paid mortgage escrow amounts and closing costs that were payable by that joint venture. The remaining costs totaled $
6,080
as of September 30, 2023 and are included in other assets, net, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. RMR provides management services to each of the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV. See Note 9 for further information regarding those management agreements with RMR.

and $
77
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $
132
and $
225
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
For further information about these and other such relationships and certain other related person transactions, see our Annual Report.
Note 11.
Income Taxes
We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and, as such, are generally not subject to federal and most state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements. We do, however, lease our managed senior living communities to our wholly owned TRSs that, unlike most of our subsidiaries, file a separate consolidated federal corporate income tax return and are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our consolidated income tax provision includes the income tax provision related to the operations of our TRSs and certain state income taxes we incur despite our taxation as a REIT. Our current income tax expense (or benefit) fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our income, including gains on the disposition of properties or losses in a particular quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $
189
and $
13
, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized income tax expense of $
379
and $
845
, respectively.
Note 12.
Weighted Average Common Share
s (share amounts in thousands)
We calculate basic earnings per common share using the two class method. We calculate diluted earnings per share using the more dilutive of the two class method or the treasury stock method. Unvested share awards and other potentially dilutive common shares, together with the related impact on earnings, are considered when calculating diluted earnings per share.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report.
OVERVIEW
We are a REIT organized under Maryland law and which owns medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2023, we wholly owned 376 properties located in 36 states and Washington, D.C., including six properties classified as held for sale and five closed senior living communities. At September 30, 2023, the gross book value of our real estate assets at cost plus certain acquisition costs, before depreciation and purchase price allocations and less impairment write downs, was $7.2 billion.
On April 11, 2023, we and OPI entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which we and OPI agreed that we would merge with and into OPI, with OPI as the surviving entity in the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. On September 1, 2023, we and OPI mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement and entered into the Termination Agreement. The mutual termination of the Merger Agreement was separately recommended by special committees of our and OPI’s respective board of trustees and approved by our and OPI’s respective board of trustees. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the termination of the Merger Agreement was effective as of September 1, 2023. Neither we nor OPI are required to pay any termination fee as a result of the mutual decision to terminate the Merger Agreement. We and OPI will bear our and its respective costs and expenses related to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. For more information regarding the merger, see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
As of September 30, 2023, we owned an equity interest in each of the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV that own medical office and life science properties located in five states with an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet that were 99% leased with an average (by annualized rental income) remaining lease term of 5.5 years.
We are closely monitoring the impacts of the current economic and market conditions on all aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, labor availability constraints, wage and commodity price inflation, rising or sustained high interest rates, increased insurance costs, geopolitical risks and economic downturns or recessions. We expect labor, insurance and food costs to continue to increase with respect to our SHOP segment.
In response to inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve has significantly increased the federal funds rate since the beginning of 2022 and it is unclear whether there will be additional increases. These inflationary pressures and rising interest rates in the United States and globally, and global geopolitical hostilities and tensions, have given rise to concerns that the U.S. economy may soon enter an economic downturn or recession and they have caused disruptions in the financial markets. An economic recession, or continued or intensified disruptions in the financial markets, could adversely affect our financial condition and that of our managers, operators and tenants, could adversely impact the ability or willingness of our managers, operators, tenants or residents to pay the contractual amounts of returns, rents or other obligations due to us, could impair our ability to effectively deploy our capital or realize our target returns on our investments, may restrict our access to, and would likely increase our cost of, capital and may cause the values of our properties and of our securities to decline.
The senior living industry experienced significant disruptions during, and in the aftermath of, the COVID-19 pandemic. Although our and certain of our managers' and other operators' and tenants' businesses have improved from low points experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the recovery of our SHOP segment has been slower than previously anticipated and uneven, and we cannot be sure when or if the senior housing business will return to historic pre-pandemic levels due to changed market practices, delayed returns to prior market practices, current market and economic conditions, such as rising or sustained high interest rates, wage and commodity price inflation, limited labor availability, increased insurance costs, geopolitical risks and economic downturns or recessions, or otherwise. For example, although occupancy in our SHOP segment has increased, the rate of occupancy growth has been slower than previously anticipated and uneven and increased operating costs resulting from wage and commodity price inflation, limited labor availability and increased insurance costs, among other things, continue to negatively impact margins. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to determine what the ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be on our, our managers', operators', our tenants' and other stakeholders' businesses, operations, financial results and financial position. For further information and risks relating to these economic uncertainties, including changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on our business and financial condition, see Part I, Item 1, "Business" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars and square feet in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
We operate in, and report financial information for, the following two segments: Office Portfolio and SHOP. We aggregate each of these two reporting segments based on their similar operating and economic characteristics. Our Office Portfolio segment consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties leased to biotech laboratories and other similar tenants. Our SHOP segment consists of managed senior living communities that provide short term and long term residential living and, in some instances, care and other services for residents where we pay fees to managers to operate the communities on our behalf.
We also report “non-segment” operations, which consists of triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators from which we receive rents, which we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reporting segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reporting segment.
The following table summarizes the results of operations of each of our segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:

Rental income.
Rental income decreased primarily due to a tenant default at one of our properties and certain of our properties being taken out of service and/or currently undergoing redevelopment, partially offset by an increase in rental income at certain of our recently redeveloped properties, our acquisition of one property since July 1, 2022 and an increase in rental income at our comparable properties. Rental income increased at our comparable properties primarily due to an increase in occupancy, higher
28
average rents resulting from our new and renewal leasing activity, increased parking revenue at certain of our comparable properties and increases in property operating expense reimbursements at certain of our comparable properties.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, management fees, salaries and benefit costs of property level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these properties. The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in property operating expenses at our comparable properties and our acquisition of one property since July 1, 2022, partially offset by certain of our properties being taken out of service and/or currently undergoing redevelopment. Property operating expenses at our comparable properties increased primarily due to increases in utility expenses, insurance expense and other direct costs at certain of our comparable properties, partially offset by decreases in real estate taxes.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.

Consists of senior living communities that we have owned and which have been in service, reported in the same segment and operated by the same operator continuously since July 1, 2022; excludes communities classified as held for sale, closed or out of service, if any.
(2)
Average monthly rate is calculated by taking the average daily rate, which is defined as total residents fees and services divided by occupied units during the period, and multiplying it by 30 days.
Residents fees and services.
Residents fees and services are the revenues earned at our managed senior living communities. We recognize these revenues as services are provided and related fees are accrued. Residents fees and services increased primarily due to increases in occupancy and average monthly rate at our communities and the transfer of three previously leased communities to our SHOP segment as described below, partially offset by one community that was taken out of service due to damage sustained by Hurricane Ian.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, wages and benefit costs of community level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, management fees, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these communities. Property operating expenses increased primarily due to increases in labor costs, insurance costs, increased sales and marketing costs to improve occupancy and the transfer of three previously leased communities to our SHOP segment as described below, partially offset by one community that was taken out of service due to damage sustained by Hurricane Ian.
Net operating income.

Non-segment operations consists of all of our other operations, including certain senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators, which segment we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reporting segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reporting segment.
(2)
Consists of properties that we have owned and which have been reported in the same segment and leased to the same operator continuously since July 1, 2022; excludes properties classified as held for sale, if any.
Rental income.
Rental income decreased primarily due to the termination of the lease agreements for three of our senior living communities which were replaced with management agreements under our TRS structure in October 2022, partially offset by an increase in rental income at our comparable properties. The increase in comparable properties rental income was primarily due to the net leasing activity at our wellness centers. In January 2023, we agreed to amend the lease for three of our wellness centers and repossess the remaining three wellness centers from a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. In February 2023, we entered into a 15 year lease, which commenced in June 2023, with a private operator for one of these repossessed wellness centers. In March 2023, we entered into two separate 20 year leases, which are expected to commence in 2024, with an operator for the remaining two repossessed wellness centers.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes and other expenses we paid on behalf of a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. Pursuant to an agreement with this tenant in January 2023, we expect to continue to incur real estate taxes and other direct costs for three of these wellness centers. We will also continue to pay real estate taxes and other direct costs for two wellness centers until the leases commence, which we expect to occur in 2024.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.
Consolidated
:
Depreciation and amortization expense.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the purchase of capital improvements at certain of our properties and our acquisition of one property since July 1, 2022. Increases in depreciation and amortization expenses were partially offset by certain depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since July 1, 2022.
General and administrative expense
. General and administrative expense consists of fees paid to RMR under our business management agreement, legal and accounting fees, fees and expenses of our Trustees, equity compensation expense and other costs relating to our status as a publicly traded company. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to an increase in legal fees, partially offset by a decrease in our base business management fees expense as a result of lower consolidated indebtedness and lower trading prices for our common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022.
Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs.
For the three months ended September 30, 2023, acquisition and certain other transaction related costs primarily represent costs incurred in connection with our terminated merger with OPI.
30
Impairment of assets.
For information about our asset impairment charges, see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Loss on sale of properties.
Loss on sale of properties during the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflects final adjustments related to the sale of 10 medical office and life science properties to the LSMD JV in which we retained a 20% equity interest. For further information regarding loss on sale of properties, see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of our Annual Report.
Losses on equity securities, net.
Losses on equity securities, net, represent the net unrealized losses to adjust our former investment in AlerisLife to its fair value. For further information regarding our former investment in AlerisLife, see Notes 5 and 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Interest and other income.
The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to lower average invested cash balances, partially offset by increased interest rates on invested cash balances during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022.
Interest expense.
Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in interest rates under our credit facility, which was partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings under our credit facility in connection with repayments aggregating $250,000 related to amendments of our credit facility.
Income tax expense
. Income tax expense is the result of operating income we earned in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes.
Equity in net (losses) earnings of investees.
Equity in net (losses) earnings of investees is the change in the fair value of our investments in our joint ventures.

Consists of medical office and life science properties that we have owned and which have been in service continuously since January 1, 2022; excludes properties classified as held for sale or out of service undergoing redevelopment, if any, and properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in each of which we own an equity interest.
Rental income.
Rental income increased primarily due to our acquisition of one property since January 1, 2022 and an increase in rental income at our comparable properties and at certain of our recently redeveloped properties, partially offset by a tenant default at one of our properties resulting in a write off of the corresponding unamortized straight line rent receivable, the
32
deconsolidation of 10 medical office and life science properties currently owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own an equity interest and certain of our properties being taken out of service and/or currently undergoing redevelopment. Rental income increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in occupancy, higher average rents resulting from our new and renewal leasing activity, increases in property operating expense reimbursements at certain of our comparable properties and increased parking revenue at certain of our comparable properties.
Property operating expenses.
The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to an increase in property operating expenses at our comparable properties, at certain of our recently redeveloped properties and our acquisition of one property since January 1, 2022, partially offset by the deconsolidation of 10 medical office and life science properties currently owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own an equity interest. Property operating expenses at our comparable properties increased primarily due to increases in insurance expense, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance expense and other direct costs at certain of our comparable properties, partially offset by decreases in landscaping expenses.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.

Average monthly rate is calculated by taking the average daily rate, which is defined as total residents fees and services divided by occupied units during the period, and multiplying it by 30 days.
Residents fees and services.
Residents fees and services increased primarily due to increases in occupancy and average monthly rate at our communities and the transfer of three previously leased communities to our SHOP segment as described below, partially offset by one community that was taken out of service due to damage sustained by Hurricane Ian.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses increased primarily due to increases in labor costs, insurance costs, increased sales and marketing costs to improve occupancy and the transfer of three previously leased communities to our SHOP segment as described below, partially offset by one community that was taken out of service due to damage sustained by Hurricane Ian.

Non-segment operations consists of all of our other operations, including certain senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators, which segment we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reporting segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reporting segment.
(2)
Consists of properties that we have owned and which have been reported in the same segment and leased to the same operator continuously since January 1, 2022; excludes properties classified as held for sale, if any.
Rental income.
Rental income decreased primarily due to the termination of the lease agreements for three of our senior living communities which were replaced with management agreements under our TRS structure in October 2022 and a decrease in rental income at our comparable properties. The decrease in comparable properties rental income was primarily due to cash rents received during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers, partially offset by the net leasing activity at our wellness centers. In January 2023, we agreed to amend the lease for three of these wellness centers and repossess the remaining three wellness centers. In February 2023, we entered into a 15 year lease, which commenced in June 2023, with a private operator for one of these repossessed wellness centers. In March 2023, we entered into two separate 20 year leases, which are expected to commence in 2024, with an operator for the remaining two repossessed wellness centers.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes and other expenses we paid on behalf of a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. Pursuant to an agreement with this tenant in January 2023, we expect to continue to incur real estate taxes and other direct costs for three of these wellness centers. We will also continue to pay real estate taxes and other direct costs for two wellness centers until the leases commence, which we expect to occur in 2024.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.
Consolidated
:
Depreciation and amortization expense.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the purchase of capital improvements at certain of our properties and our acquisition of one property since January 1, 2022. Increases in depreciation and amortization expenses were partially offset by the deconsolidation of 10 medical office and life science properties owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in which we own an equity interest and certain depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated since January 1, 2022.
General and administrative expense
. General and administrative expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in our base business management fees expense as a result of lower consolidated indebtedness and lower trading prices for our common shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by an increase in legal fees.
Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, acquisition and certain other transaction related costs primarily represent costs incurred in connection with our terminated merger with OPI. For the nine
34
months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, acquisition and certain other transaction related costs also include costs related to the transition of certain senior living communities to other third party managers.
Impairment of assets.
For information about our asset impairment charges, see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Gain on sale of properties.
Gain on sale of properties is the net result of our sales of certain of our properties and joint venture equity interests during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The gain on sale of properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflects our sale of 10 medical office and life science properties to the LSMD JV in which we retained a 20% equity interest and our sale of a 10% equity interest in the Seaport JV. For further information regarding gain on sale of properties, see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of our Annual Report.
Gains and losses on equity securities, net.
Gains and losses on equity securities, net, represent the net realized and unrealized gains and losses to adjust our former investment in AlerisLife to its fair value. For further information regarding our former investment in AlerisLife, see Notes 5 and 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Interest and other income.
The increase in interest and other income is primarily due to higher interest earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of higher interest rates compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest and other income is also due to $1,581 of funds we received from certain programs under the CARES Act, ARPA and various state programs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $1,084 received during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Interest expense.
Interest expense decreased primarily due to our redemption of $500,000 of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 in June 2022 and a decrease in average borrowings under our credit facility in connection with repayments aggregating $250,000 related to amendments of our credit facility. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest rates under our credit facility.
Loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt in connection with amendments to our credit agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we also recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with our redemption of $500,000 of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025, partially offset by a gain on early extinguishment of debt in connection with our prepayment of a mortgage note.
Income tax expense
. Income tax expense is the result of operating income we earned in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes.
Equity in net earnings of investees.
Equity in net earnings of investees is the change in the fair value of our investments in our joint ventures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
We present certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including funds from operations, or FFO, normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, and NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties.
Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations
We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of unconsolidated joint ventures, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of FFO of our former equity method investment in AlerisLife for the periods we had an equity investment in AlerisLife that we accounted for as an equity method investment and our proportionate share of FFO from our unconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items shown below including similar adjustments for our unconsolidated joint ventures, if any. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing our debt, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations.
O
ther real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.
Our calculations of FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and reconciliations of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements, to FFO and Normalized FFO appear in the following table. This table also provides a comparison of distributions to shareholders, FFO and Normalized FFO and net income (loss) per share for these periods.

Property Net Operating Income (NOI)
We calculate NOI as shown below. The calculation of NOI excludes certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level results of operations. We define NOI as income from our real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that we record as depreciation and amortization. We use NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI differently than we do.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal sources of cash to meet operating and capital expenses, pay debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders are the operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our leased properties, residents fees and services revenues from our managed communities and proceeds from the disposition of certain properties. Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon:
•
our ability to receive rents from our tenants;
•
our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy of, and the rates at, our properties;
•
our and our managers' abilities to control operating expenses and capital expenses at our properties, including increased operating expenses that we may incur in response to wage and commodity price inflation, limited labor availability and increased insurance costs; and
•
our managers' abilities to maintain or increase our returns from our managed senior living communities.
The senior living industry has been adversely affected by a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as economic and market conditions. These conditions continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Although there have been signs of recovery and increased demand when compared to the low levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, the recovery of our SHOP segment has been slower than previously anticipated and uneven, and we cannot be sure when or if the senior living business will return to historic pre-pandemic levels. To mitigate the effects of the slow recovery coming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased variability in operating cash flows from our SHOP communities, we continue to work with our senior living operators to manage costs, especially labor costs, and to increase rates and occupancy. However, increased operating costs resulting from difficult labor market conditions, wage and commodity price inflation and insurance costs, among other things, continue to negatively impact margins. Additionally, while
38
Table of Contents
our senior living operators have increased rates, those rates are increasing gradually and are not increasing at the same pace as our costs, putting further pressure on our margins. In order to increase the probability of a recovery of our cash flows, we have continued to invest capital in our SHOP segment, which has reduced our cash balances since the filing of our Annual Report on March 1, 2023. As a result of our decreased cash balances, we have deferred, and may continue to defer, future capital expenditures to preserve liquidity, which may slow the pace of any recovery of our cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service was below the 1.5x incurrence requirement under our credit agreement and our public debt covenants, and we cannot be certain how long this ratio will remain below 1.5x. We are unable to refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt until this ratio is at or above 1.5x on a pro forma basis. As of September 30, 2023, we had $278.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $700.0 million of outstanding debt due within one year from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including $450.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility which matures on January 15, 2024 and $250.0 million of senior notes that mature on May 1, 2024. Our credit facility is secured by 62 properties which had an appraised value of approximately $1.1 billion based on appraisals completed in 2023.
Based on the challenges described above, as well as our reduced cash balances, additional capital commitments in both our Office Portfolio and SHOP segments and upcoming debt maturities, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In September 2023, subsequent to the termination of our proposed merger with OPI, we engaged B. Riley as a financial advisor to help us evaluate our options to address our near term capital needs, including the upcoming debt maturities described above. Among the alternatives being considered to address our near term capital needs are raising permissible new capital, including by selling assets, as well as seeking an extension of the maturity date of our credit facility. Regarding any new capital that may be raised, we are limited in the type of financings we can pursue as we cannot currently refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt, as described above. We are in the pre-marketing stage of a disposition program, which currently includes 66 properties, to increase liquidity to repay maturing debt and to continue to fund capital expenditures. We are also engaging in discussions with the lenders under our $450.0 million credit facility regarding an amendment to our credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the facility, amend certain covenants and allow us to repay maturing debt, among other things. While we believe that the new capital we expect to raise, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, and the possible extension of the maturity date of our credit facility, will alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we cannot provide assurance that we will raise new capital or sell assets or that any new capital raised, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, will be sufficient to repay our maturing debt or that our lenders will agree to an extension of the maturity date of our credit facility. Due to challenging capital market conditions, in particular with respect to commercial real estate, we do not believe that it is probable, as of the date of issuance of the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that we will raise sufficient new capital, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, to meet our upcoming contractual commitments. As of November 1, 2023, we cannot demonstrate that our management's plans to alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern will be probable in mitigating the conditions that raise the substantial doubt because our plan to raise permissible new capital, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, and to extend the maturity date of our credit facility, is subject to market conditions and lender approvals, among other things, which are beyond our control.
In March 2021, we borrowed $800.0 million under our credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, we repaid $100.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the facility commitments were reduced to $700.0 million. In February 2022, we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our credit facility by one year to January 2024, and in January 2023, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, we repaid $113.6 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the facility commitments were reduced to $586.4 million. In February 2023, pursuant to an amendment to our credit agreement, we repaid $136.4 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the facility commitments were further reduced to $450.0 million. We have no additional options to extend the maturity date of our credit facility and, pursuant to the February 2023 amendment to our credit agreement, the feature of our credit facility permitting us to reborrow any repaid funds was eliminated. Although we continue to take steps to enhance our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, a protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage and commodity price inflation, rising or sustained high interest rates, increased insurance costs, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, downturns or recessions, may cause further increased pressure on our ability to satisfy financial and other covenants. We may fail to satisfy covenants and conditions under our credit agreement or fail to satisfy our public debt covenants. In addition, we may be unable to repay the $450.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility if we do not succeed in realizing our plan to address the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern or if that plan is not successful. If we believe we will not be able to satisfy our financial or other covenants, we expect that we would seek waivers or amendments prior to any covenant violation or seek other financing alternatives. Any such waiver or amendment may result in increased costs and interest rates, additional restrictive covenants or other lender protections imposed on us. For example, we
39
Table of Contents
are currently engaging in discussions with the lenders under our credit facility regarding a possible extension and amendment of that facility, as described above. As of September 30, 2023, our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service was below the 1.5x incurrence requirement under our credit facility and our public debt covenants as the effects of the current market conditions continued to adversely impact our operations. We are unable to refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt until this ratio is at or above 1.5x on a pro forma basis.
In January 2022, we entered into a joint venture with two unrelated third party institutional investors for 10 medical office and life science properties we owned for aggregate proceeds, before closing costs and other adjustments, of $653.3 million. The equity interests that the investors acquired from us equaled 41% and 39%, respectively, of the total equity interests in the joint venture and we retained a 20% equity interest in the joint venture. Following the sale, we account for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting under the fair value option. The initial investment amounts were based upon a property valuation of approximately $702.5 million, less approximately $456.6 million of secured debt on the properties incurred by this joint venture.
In June 2022, we sold an additional 10% equity interest in the Seaport JV to an existing joint venture investor for aggregate proceeds, before closing costs and other adjustments, of $108.0 million. After giving effect to this sale, we continue to own a 10% equity interest in this joint venture. Our initial investment amount was based on a property valuation of $1.7 billion, less $620.0 million of existing mortgage debts on the property that this joint venture assumed.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold three properties for an aggregate sales price of $2.8 million, excluding closing costs. In October 2023, we sold three properties for an aggregate sales price of $10.8 million, excluding closing costs. As of October 27, 2023, we had one property under an agreement to sell for a sales price of approximately $1.8 million, excluding closing costs. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result.

Our Operating Liquidity and Resources
We generally receive minimum rents from tenants at our Office Portfolio properties, triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers monthly, we receive residents fees and services revenues, net of expenses, from our managed senior living communities monthly and we receive percentage rents from tenants at certain of our senior living communities monthly, quarterly or annually.
The change in cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to increased NOI as a result of increased rates and occupancy at the senior living communities in our SHOP segment. Additionally, interest payments decreased in the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period primarily due to our redemption of $500,000 of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 in June 2022. These increases were partially offset by an increase in costs incurred in connection with our terminated merger with OPI.
Although we have seen signs of recovery as it relates to our SHOP segment, the recovery of our SHOP segment has been slower than previously anticipated and uneven, and we face and may continue to face issues with limited labor availability and wage inflation along with cost pressures from increased insurance premiums and commodity price inflation and possible reduced demand for senior living communities.

Our Investing Liquidity and Resources
The change in cash (used in) provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to proceeds in the 2022 period from our sale of 10 medical office and life science properties to the LSMD JV in which we retained a 20% equity interest and our sale of a 10% equity interest in the Seaport JV, partially offset by a property acquisition in the 2022 period, a decrease in real estate improvements in the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period and the proceeds received from the tender of all of the 10,691,658 AlerisLife common shares we owned at a price of $1.31 per share in the 2023 period.

Lease related costs generally include capital expenditures to improve tenants' space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space and other leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions and tenant inducements.
(2)
Building improvements generally include capital expenditures to replace obsolete building components that extend the useful life of existing assets or other improvements to increase the marketability of the property.
(3)
Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditures that reposition a property or result in new sources of revenue.
We generally plan to continue investing capital in our properties, including redevelopment projects, to better position these properties in their respective markets in order to increase our returns in future years. However, we have deferred, and may continue to defer, our capital expenditures to preserve liquidity.
As of September 30, 2023, we had estimated unspent leasing related obligations at our triple net leased wellness centers and our medical office and life science properties of approximately $66.9 million, of which we expect to spend approximately $48.4 million during the next 12 months. We expect to fund these obligations using operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our leased properties, residents fees and services revenues from our managed communities, cash on hand, proceeds from the disposition of certain properties and proceeds related to contributions we may make of properties we own to joint ventures.
We are currently in the process of redeveloping several properties in our Office Portfolio and a number of our managed senior living communities, which projects are expected to be completed at various times between 2023 and 2025. We continue to assess opportunities to redevelop other properties in our Office Portfolio and SHOP segment. These redevelopment projects may require significant capital expenditures and time to complete, and we have deferred, and may continue to defer, certain redevelopment projects to preserve liquidity.
Our ability to make capital investments is currently limited under our credit agreement and may become more limited as we contemplate deferring further capital investments to preserve liquidity. Additionally, due to labor availability constraints and wage and commodity price inflation, the capital investments we plan to make may be delayed or cost more than we expect. For further information regarding our dispositions, see Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Our Financing Liquidity and Resources
The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the prior period was primarily due to our redemption of $500,000 of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 in June 2022, partially offset by higher repayments of borrowings under our credit facility in the 2023 period compared to the 2022 period.
As of September 30, 2023, we had $278.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and were fully drawn under our credit facility. We typically use cash balances, net proceeds from offerings of securities, debt issuances or dispositions of assets and cash flows from our operations to fund our operations, debt repayments, distributions, acquisitions, investments, capital expenditures and other general business purposes.
In order to fund investments and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a credit facility. The maturity date of our credit facility is January 15, 2024. At September 30, 2023, our credit facility required interest to be paid on borrowings at the annual rate of 8.3%, plus a facility fee of $0.3 million per quarter. On March 31, 2021, we borrowed $800.0 million under our credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, we repaid $100.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the facility commitments were reduced to $700.0 million. Also in February 2022, we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our credit facility by one year to January 2024, and in January 2023, pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement, we repaid $113.6 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the facility commitments were reduced to $586.4 million. In February 2023, pursuant to an amendment to our credit agreement, we repaid $136.4 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the facility commitments were further reduced to $450.0 million. We have no additional options to extend the maturity date of our credit facility. As of September 30, 2023 and October 27, 2023, we were fully drawn under our credit facility. We are currently engaging in discussions with the lenders under our credit facility regarding a possible extension and amendment of that facility, as described elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 10-Q.
In February 2022, we and our lenders amended our credit agreement. Pursuant to the amendment:
•
the waiver of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant included in our credit agreement was extended through December 31, 2022;
•
the facility commitments were reduced from $800.0 million to $700.0 million;
•
we have the ability to fund $400.0 million of capital expenditures per year and we are restricted in our ability to acquire real property as defined in our credit agreement;
•
the interest premium under our credit facility increased by 15 basis points; and
•
certain financial covenants and restrictions on distributions to common shareholders, share repurchases, capital expenditures, acquiring additional properties and incurring additional indebtedness (in each case subject to various exceptions), and the minimum liquidity requirement of $200.0 million remained in place through December 31, 2022.
In February 2023, we and our lenders further amended our credit agreement. Pursuant to the amendment:
•
the waiver of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant has been extended through the maturity date of our credit facility, or January 15, 2024;
•
the minimum liquidity requirement was decreased from $200.0 million to $100.0 million;
•
the facility commitments were reduced from $586.4 million to $450.0 million following our repayment of $136.4 million in then outstanding borrowings, and as a result of the reduction in commitments, we recorded a loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023;
•
the feature of our credit facility permitting us to reborrow any repaid funds was eliminated;
•
we continue to have the ability to fund $400.0 million of capital expenditures per year and we are restricted in our ability to acquire real property as defined in the credit agreement;
42
Table of Contents
•
SOFR was established as the replacement benchmark rate in place of LIBOR to calculate interest payable on amounts outstanding under our credit facility, and the interest premium under our credit facility was increased by 40 basis points; and
•
we are required to repay outstanding amounts under our credit facility with excess cash flow, and certain financial covenants and restrictions on distributions to common shareholders, share repurchases, capital expenditures, acquiring additional properties and incurring additional indebtedness (in each case subject to various exceptions) will remain in place through the maturity date of our credit facility.
Our credit agreement requires us to maintain collateral properties with an aggregate appraised value of at least $1.09 billion, and allows the Administrative Agent to periodically reappraise the collateral properties. On June 23, 2023, the Administrative Agent notified us that the reappraised value of the then 61 medical office and life science properties securing our credit facility since September 2021 had declined from $1.34 billion to $1.05 billion, below the $1.09 billion threshold required under our credit agreement. Failure to meet the required threshold constitutes a non-monetary event of default under our credit agreement. In July 2023, we obtained a limited waiver from the Administrative Agent and requisite lenders under our credit facility, which waived the event of default and decreased the required appraised value of the collateral properties through September 30, 2023. In September 2023, we pledged the equity interests of an additional subsidiary owning one medical office property to secure our obligations under our credit agreement and provided a first mortgage lien on such medical office property. As of September 30, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with this covenant.
Generally, when significant amounts are outstanding under our credit facility, or as the maturities of our indebtedness approach, we intend to explore, and are currently exploring, refinancing alternatives, as well as the possible extension of the applicable maturity dates. Such alternatives include selling certain properties and issuing new equity securities. In addition, we may also seek to expand our existing joint venture arrangements or to participate in additional joint ventures or other arrangements that may provide us additional sources of financing. We currently have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. Also, we are currently limited in the type of financings we can pursue as we cannot refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt due to our non-compliance with our debt incurrence covenants, as discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders totaling approximately $7.2 million using existing cash balances. On October 12, 2023, we declared a quarterly distribution payable to common shareholders of record on October 23, 2023 in the amount of $0.01 per share, or approximately $2.4 million. We expect to pay this distribution on or about November 16, 2023 using cash on hand. For further information regarding the distribution we paid during 2022, see Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
We believe we may have access to certain types of financings to fund our operations and repay our debts and other obligations as they become due. Our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt or equity transactions depends primarily upon credit market conditions and our then creditworthiness and our ability to be in compliance with our debt covenants as discussed below. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit and debt ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully carry out that intention. A protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate, wage and commodity price inflation, rising or sustained high interest rates, increased insurance costs, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, downturns and recessions, may have various negative consequences including a decline in financing availability and increased costs for financing. Further, those conditions could also disrupt capital markets and limit our access to financing from public sources, particularly if the global financial markets experience significant disruptions.
In April 2023, we prepaid a mortgage note secured by one of our senior living communities with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $14.6 million, a maturity date in June 2023 and an annual interest rate of 6.64% using cash on hand.
In January 2023, Moody's Investors Service, or Moody's, downgraded our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 rating from B3 to Caa3, our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 rating from B3 to Caa3 and our senior unsecured debt rating from Caa1 to Ca. In

Table of Contents
February 2023, Standard & Poor's Rating Services, or Standard & Poor's, downgraded our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 rating from BB- to B, our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 rating from BB- to B and our senior unsecured debt rating from B to CCC+. In September 2023, Moody's downgraded our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 rating from Caa3 to Ca, our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 rating from Caa3 to Ca and our senior unsecured debt rating from Ca to C. In September 2023, Standard & Poor's downgraded our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 rating from B to CCC+, our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 rating from B to CCC+ and our senior unsecured debt rating from CCC+ to CCC-.
Our next significant debt maturity is our credit facility, which matures in January 2024, followed by $250.0 million of senior unsecured notes that mature in May 2024.
For further information regarding our outstanding debt, see Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Debt Covenants
Our principal debt obligations at September 30, 2023 were: (1) $450.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility; (2) $2.4 billion outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured notes; and (3) $9.5 million aggregate principal amount of mortgage notes (excluding premiums, discounts and net debt issuance costs) secured by one property. For further information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Our senior unsecured notes are governed by our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements. Our credit agreement and our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, as defined, which includes RMR ceasing to act as our business and property manager. Our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements and our credit agreement also contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts and require us to maintain various financial ratios, and our credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in certain circumstances. As of September 30, 2023, our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service was below the 1.5x incurrence requirement under our credit agreement and our public debt covenants as the effects of the slower than anticipated and uneven recovery of our SHOP business from the COVID-19 pandemic, wage and commodity price inflation, rising interest rates, increased insurance costs, geopolitical risks and other economic, market and industry conditions continued to adversely impact our operations. We are unable to refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt until this ratio is at or above 1.5x on a pro forma basis. As of September 30, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with all of the other covenants under our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements, our credit agreement and our other debt obligations, subject to the waivers described above. Although we continue to take steps to enhance our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, as noted elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage or commodity price inflation, rising or sustained high interest rates, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, downturns or recessions, may cause increased pressure on our ability to satisfy financial and other covenants. If our operating results and financial condition are significantly negatively impacted by economic conditions or otherwise, we may fail to satisfy covenants and conditions under our credit agreement or fail to satisfy our public debt covenants. In addition, we may be unable to repay the $450.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility if we do not succeed in realizing our plan to address the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern or if that plan is not successful. Further, if we believe we will not be able to satisfy our financial or other covenants, we expect that we would seek waivers or amendments prior to any covenant violation or seek other financing alternatives. Any such waiver or amendment may result in increased costs and interest rates, additional restrictive covenants or other lender protections imposed on us. For example, we are currently engaging in discussions with the lenders under our credit facility regarding a possible extension and amendment of that facility, as described above. We cannot assure that we would be able to obtain these waivers or amendments or repay the related debt facilities when due, which may result in an event of default under the agreements governing our debt or the potential acceleration of our outstanding debt.
Neither our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements, nor our credit agreement, contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. See "—Our Financing Liquidity and Resources" above for information regarding recent downgrades of our issuer credit rating and senior unsecured debt rating.
Our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of more than $20.0 million ($50.0 million or more in the case of our senior unsecured notes indentures and supplements entered in
44
Table of Contents
February 2016, February 2018, June 2020 and February 2021). Similarly, our credit agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of $25.0 million or more and indebtedness that is non-recourse of $75.0 million or more.
The loan agreements governing the aggregate $620.0 million secured debt financing related to the Seaport JV contain customary covenants and provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. We no longer include this $620.0 million of secured debt financing in our condensed consolidated balance sheet following the deconsolidation of the net assets of this joint venture; however, we continue to provide certain guaranties on this debt. The debt secured by the properties included in the LSMD JV in which we own a 20% equity interest is guaranteed by this joint venture and is non-recourse to us.
Supplemental Guarantor Information
On May 28, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025. We subsequently redeemed $500.0 million of this debt in June 2022, with $500.0 million remaining outstanding. On February 3, 2021, we issued $500.0 million of our 4.375% senior notes due 2031. As of September 30, 2023, all $500.0 million of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and all $500.0 million of our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis and on a senior unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries, except for certain excluded subsidiaries, including pledged subsidiaries under our credit agreement. The notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining $1.35 billion of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees as of September 30, 2023.
A subsidiary guarantor's guarantee of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, as applicable, and all other obligations of such subsidiary guarantor under the indenture governing the notes will automatically terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will automatically be released from all of its obligations under such subsidiary guarantee and the indenture under certain circumstances, including on or after the date (a) the notes have an investment grade rating from two rating agencies and one of such investment grade ratings is a mid-BBB investment grade rating and (b) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 or our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 or the respective guarantees, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. The rights of holders of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, as applicable, to benefit from any of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries are subject to the prior satisfaction of claims of those subsidiaries' creditors and any preferred equity holders. As a result, our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 and the respective guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, including guarantees of other indebtedness of ours, payment obligations under lease agreements, trade payables and preferred equity.
The following tables present summarized financial information for guarantor entities and issuer, on a combined basis after eliminating (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantor entities and (ii) equity in earnings from, and any investments in, any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor (dollars in thousands):

Related Person Transactions
We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR, RMR Inc., AlerisLife (including Five Star) and others related to them. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 8, 9 and 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, see the section captioned “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairments of real estate and intangible assets.
A discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since the year ended December 31, 2022.
Impact of Government Reimbursement
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, substantially all of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from our tenants' and residents' private resources, and a small amount of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from Medicare and Medicaid payments. Nonetheless, we own, and our tenants, managers and operators operate, facilities in many states that participate in federal and state healthcare payment programs, including the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare payment programs. Also, some of our medical office and life science property tenants participate in federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other government healthcare payment programs.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in interest and other income in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to funds received under the CARES Act, ARPA and various state programs in which certain of our communities in our SHOP segment are located.
For more information regarding the government healthcare funding and regulation of our business, please see the section captioned “Business—Government Regulation and Reimbursement” in our Annual Report and the section captioned “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Government Reimbursement” in our Annual Report.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Other than as described below, we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future.
We may in the future enter into hedge arrangements or derivative contracts from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates.

The principal balances and interest rates are the amounts stated in the applicable contracts. In accordance with GAAP, our carrying values and recorded interest expense may differ from these amounts because of market conditions at the time we assumed certain of these debts. This table does not include obligations under finance leases.

As of September 30, 2023, these senior notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed. For further information, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
No principal repayments are due under our unsecured notes until maturity. Our mortgage notes generally require principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to amortization schedules. Because these debts require interest to be paid at a fixed rate, changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our interest obligations. If these debts were refinanced at interest rates which are one percentage point higher or lower than shown above, our annual interest cost would increase or decrease by approximately $23.6 million.
Changes in market interest rates also would affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations; increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt, while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022 in an effort to combat inflation and may continue to do so.
Our senior unsecured notes and our mortgage note contain provisions that allow us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date. In some cases, we are not allowed to make early repayment prior to a cutoff date and we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount, as defined, which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the noteholder. In the past, we have repurchased and retired some of our outstanding debt and we may do so again in the future. These prepayment rights and our ability to repurchase and retire outstanding debt may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risk of refinancing our debts at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity.
Floating Rate Debt
At September 30, 2023, our floating rate debt obligations consisted of $450.0 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our credit facility matures in January 2024.
Borrowings under our credit facility are in U.S. dollars and interest is required to be paid at the rate of SOFR plus a premium as defined in our credit agreement. Accordingly, we are exposed to interest rate risk for changes in U.S. dollar based short term rates. In addition, upon any potential renewal or refinancing of our credit facility, we are vulnerable to increases in interest premiums due to market conditions or our perceived credit characteristics. Generally, a change in interest rates would not affect the value of our floating rate debt but would affect our operating results.

The foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate increase in floating interest rates. If interest rates were to increase gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the amount of our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility or other floating rate debt.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.
Other Information
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties
, a number of which are described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report. The risks described in our Annual Report and below may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Other risks of which we are not yet aware, or that we currently believe are not material, may also materially and adversely impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the risk factors contained in our Annual Report or included below occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or ability to pay distributions to our shareholders could be adversely impacted and the value of an investment in our securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the risks described in our Annual Report and below and the information contained under the caption “Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q before deciding whether to invest in our securities.
Risks Relating to Going Concern
We have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The senior living industry has been adversely affected by the slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as current economic and market conditions. These conditions continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service was below the 1.5x incurrence requirement under our credit agreement and our public debt covenants as of September 30, 2023. We cannot be certain how long this ratio will remain below 1.5x, and we are unable to refinance existing or maturing debt or issue new debt until this ratio is at or above 1.5x on a pro forma basis. As of September 30, 2023, we had $278.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $450.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility which matures on January 15, 2024 and $250.0 million of senior notes that mature on May 1, 2024. Our credit facility is secured by 62 properties which had an appraised value of approximately $1.1 billion based on appraisals completed in 2023.
As discussed in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, based on these challenges and upcoming debt maturities, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon many factors, including our ability to meet our debt covenants and repay our debts and other obligations when due. While we believe raising permissible new capital, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, and the possible extension of our credit facility, will alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we cannot provide assurance that any new capital raised, including proceeds from our planned asset sales, will be available to us or sufficient to repay our upcoming maturing debt, or that our lenders will agree to an extension of the maturity date of our credit facility. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain any future debt financing, and any such debt financing we may obtain may not be sufficient to repay our upcoming maturing debt. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.

common shares. We withheld and purchased these common shares at their fair market values based upon the trading prices of our common shares at the close of trading on Nasdaq on the purchase dates.
Item 5. Other Information.
On November 1, 2023, our Board of Trustees approved and adopted our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, or our Amended Bylaws, to reduce the permitted ownership of our shares on a prospective basis, from 9.8% to 5%, in order to preserve our cumulative net operating losses.
The new Article IX of our Amended Bylaws generally provides that transfers of our shares (and certain other securities) to a person, entity or group which is then, or would become as a result, an owner of 5% or more of our outstanding shares would be void in total for transferees then already owning 5% or more of our shares and, for transferees that would otherwise become owners of 5% or more of our shares, to the extent the transfer would so result in such level of ownership by the proposed transferee. The prohibited transfer threshold was set at 5% because transfers at or above that level could result in limitations on our ability to use our net operating losses and other tax benefits to reduce our future taxable income, as provided under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, and the regulations and rulings issued thereunder. Shares relating to attempted transfers in violation of the Article IX prohibition may be subject to transfer to a charitable trust in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of our Declaration of Trust. Article VII of our Declaration of Trust also governs the treatment for our shares which are subject to other provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Amended Bylaws, including shares owned in excess of the 9.8% ownership limitation included in our Declaration of Trust and shares required to be divested due to a shareholder's failure to comply with certain regulatory matters, as further provided in our Amended Bylaws.
With respect to shareholders who held in excess of 5% of our shares outstanding prior to November 1, 2023, none of such shareholders’ shares were deemed under the new limitation to be excess securities subject to automatic transfer to a charitable trust; instead such shareholders will not be permitted to acquire additional shares while owning 5% or more of our outstanding shares or thereafter to the extent any such subsequent acquisition would result in them owning 5% or more of our outstanding shares. Our Board of Trustees or an authorized committee may approve transfers otherwise prohibited by these provisions of our Amended Bylaws.
The foregoing description of our Amended Bylaws is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.5 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, a marked copy of our Amended Bylaws indicating changes made to our bylaws as they existed immediately prior to the adoption of our Amended Bylaws is filed as Exhibit 3.6 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
