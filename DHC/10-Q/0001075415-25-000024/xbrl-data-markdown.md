| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2023-09,Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, or ASU No. 2023-09, which requires public entities to enhance their annual income tax disclosures by requiring: (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 should be applied prospectively but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We expect to include additional disclosures in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2023-09; however, these changes are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03,Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statements Expenses, or ASU No. 2024-03, which requires public entities to disclose specific expense categories such as employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization. These details must be presented in a tabular format in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for both interim and annual reporting periods. ASU 2024-03 is required to be applied prospectively but can be applied retrospectively, and is effective for the first annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. | c-1 |  |
