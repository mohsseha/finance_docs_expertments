DIVERSIFIED HEALTHCARE TRUST
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
Note 1.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Diversified Healthcare Trust and its subsidiaries, or DHC, we, us, or our, are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, or our Annual Report.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included. All intercompany transactions and balances with or among our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairments of real estate and intangible assets.
We have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be involved in claims, lawsuits, and regulatory and other governmental audits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, we do not believe any currently pending litigation or proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 2.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, or ASU No. 2023-09, which requires public entities to enhance their annual income tax disclosures by requiring: (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 should be applied prospectively but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We expect to include additional disclosures in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2023-09; however, these changes are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03,
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statements Expenses
, or ASU No. 2024-03, which requires public entities to disclose specific expense categories such as employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization. These details must be presented in a tabular format in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for both interim and annual reporting periods. ASU 2024-03 is required to be applied prospectively but can be applied retrospectively, and is effective for the first annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2024-03 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 3.
Real Estate and Other Investments
As of March 31, 2025, we owned
343
properties located in
34
states and Washington, D.C., including
11
properties classified as held for sale and
two
closed senior living communities, and we owned an equity interest in each of
two
unconsolidated joint ventures that own medical office and life science properties located in
five
states.
Dispositions:
The table below represents the sale prices, excluding closing costs, of our dispositions for the three months ended March 31, 2025. We do not believe these sales represent a strategic shift in our business. As a result, the results of operations

The net proceeds from the sale of
one
of these properties are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026, if the sale of that property is completed. We expect to sell that property during the fourth quarter of 2025 for a sales price of $
6,500
, excluding closing costs.
Subsequent to March 31, 2025, we sold
one
property for a sales price of $
11,150
, excluding closing costs. As of May 2, 2025, we had
19
properties under agreements or letters of intent to sell for an aggregate sales price of $
115,773
, excluding closing costs. The net proceeds from the sales of
two
of these properties, which have an expected aggregate sales price of $
13,118
, excluding closing costs, are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026, if the sales of such properties are completed. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties, and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result.
Impairment:
We regularly evaluate our assets for indicators of impairment. Impairment indicators may include declining tenant or resident occupancy, weak or declining profitability from the property, decreasing tenant cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and legislative, market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of an asset. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the affected assets by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from those assets. The future cash flows are subjective and are based in part on assumptions regarding hold periods, market rents and terminal capitalization rates. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recorded impairment charges of $
38,472
to adjust the carrying value of
four
medical office properties to their estimated fair value. These properties were classified as held for sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2025.

These amounts are included in equity in net earnings of investees in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 6 for further information regarding the valuation of our investment in these joint ventures.
Equity Method Investment in AlerisLife:
As of March 31, 2025, we owned approximately
34.0
% of the outstanding common shares of AlerisLife Inc., or AlerisLife. We do not control the activities that are most significant to AlerisLife and, as a result, we account for our non-controlling interest in AlerisLife using the equity method of accounting.
As of March 31, 2025, our investment in AlerisLife had a carrying value of $
7,965
. The cost basis of our investment in AlerisLife exceeded our proportionate share of AlerisLife's total stockholders' equity book value on the date of acquisition of our initial interest in AlerisLife, which was February 16, 2024, by an aggregate of $
29,500
. As required under GAAP, we are amortizing this difference to equity in earnings of an investee over 21 years, the weighted average remaining useful life of the real estate assets owned by AlerisLife and the intangible contract asset with us as of the date of acquisition. We recorded amortization of the basis difference of $
351
and $
174
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We recognized income of $(
2
) and $
111
related to our investment in AlerisLife for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts are included in equity in net earnings of investees in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). On February 14, 2025, AlerisLife paid an aggregate cash dividend of $
50,000
to its stockholders. Our pro rata share of this cash dividend was $
17,000
and our basis in the equity method investment in AlerisLife was reduced by such amount. See Note 11 for further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife.
Other:
In September 2022, certain of our managed senior living communities located in Florida experienced hurricane related damage. We carry comprehensive property, casualty, flood and business interruption insurances which covered our losses at these senior living communities, subject to a deductible. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recognized a gain on insurance recoveries of $
7,522
as a result of insurance proceeds received for these damaged senior living communities and the closing of the associated claim.

Note 4.
Leases
We are a lessor of medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties. Our leases provide our tenants with the contractual right to use and economically benefit from all of the premises demised under the leases; therefore, we have determined to evaluate our leases as lease arrangements.
Our leases provide for base rent payments and, in addition, may include variable payments. Rental income from operating leases, including any payments derived by index or market based indices, is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term when we have determined that the collectability of substantially all of the lease payments is probable. Some of our leases have options to extend or terminate the lease exercisable at the option of our tenants, which are considered when determining the lease term.
We increased rental income to record revenue on a straight line basis by $
455
and $
291
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Rents receivable, excluding receivables related to our properties classified as held for sale, if any, include $
69,948
and $
69,814
of straight line rent receivables at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in other assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We do not include in our measurement of our lease receivables certain variable payments, including changes in the index or market based indices after the inception of the lease, certain tenant reimbursements and other income until the specific events that trigger the variable payments have occurred. Such payments totaled $
10,838
and $
11,350
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, of which tenant reimbursements totaled $
10,423
and $
11,284
, respectively.
Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability:
For leases where we are the lessee, we recognize a right of use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments, with rental payments being applied to the lease liability and the right of use asset being amortized over the term of the lease. The values of the right of use assets and related liabilities representing our future obligation under the respective lease arrangements for which we are the lessee were $
19,169
and $
19,555
, respectively, as of March 31, 2025, and $
20,025
and $
20,411
, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The right of use assets and related lease liabilities are included within
other assets, net
and
other liabilities
, respectively, within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we lease equipment at certain of our managed senior living communities. These leases are short term in nature, are cancelable with no fee or do not result in an annual expense in excess of our capitalization policy and, as a result, are not recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

50
basis points every 90 days these senior secured notes remain outstanding.
(5)
We have
two
one-year
extension options for the maturity date of this loan, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. This loan requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a premium of
2.50
%, with interest-only payments through March 2027, and we have
two
six-month
extension options for the interest-only period, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. In connection with this loan, we have purchased an interest rate cap for $

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we sold

properties that secured our senior secured notes due 2026. We used aggregate net proceeds of $
299,158
from the sales of these properties to partially redeem these senior secured notes.
In March 2025, we executed a $
140,000
floating rate mortgage loan secured by
14
senior living communities in our senior housing operating portfolio, or SHOP, segment. This mortgage loan matures in March 2028 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a premium of
2.50
%, with interest-only payments through March 2027, and we have
two
six-month
extension options of the interest-only period, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. In connection with this mortgage loan, we have purchased an interest rate cap for $

140,000
of our then outstanding
9.75
% senior unsecured notes due June 2025.
In April 2025, we executed a $
108,873
fixed rate mortgage loan secured by
seven
SHOP communities. This mortgage loan matures in May 2035 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of
6.22
%, with interest-only payments through May 2030. Also in April 2025, we provided notice to the holders of our
9.75
% senior unsecured notes due June 2025 to redeem $
140,000
of these notes in May 2025 using these loan proceeds and cash on hand. Additionally, we have executed term sheets with additional lenders for expected aggregate proceeds of $
94,030
for loans that will be secured by an aggregate of
six
SHOP communities. We intend to use these proceeds and cash on hand to fully redeem the remaining outstanding principal amount of our
9.75
% senior unsecured notes due in June 2025, which is our next significant debt maturity. The closings of the additional loans are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure if we will close such loans for the expected proceeds or at all or that these closings will not be delayed.
Interest on our senior unsecured notes is payable either semi-annually or quarterly in arrears; however, no principal repayments are due until maturity. No interest is payable on our senior secured notes, with the full principal amount due at maturity. Our mortgage note due June 2034 requires monthly interest payments and no principal payment is due until maturity, and our mortgage note due July 2043 requires monthly principal and interest payments. Payments under our finance leases are due monthly. We include amortization of finance lease assets in depreciation and amortization expense.
Our senior notes indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. Our senior notes indentures and their supplements also contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts and require us to maintain various financial ratios.

Segment Reporting
Our operating segments are based on our internal reporting structure and property type and are aligned with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker, or the CODM, reviews the operating results to allocate resources and assess segment performance. The CODM is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our
two
reportable segments are Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and SHOP. Our Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio segment primarily consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties primarily leased to biotech laboratories and other similar tenants. Our SHOP segment consists of managed senior living communities that provide short term and long term residential living and, in some instances, care and other services for residents where we pay fees to managers to operate the communities on our behalf.
The significant expense categories and amounts presented below align with the segment-level information that is regularly provided to our CODM. The CODM reviews operating and financial results, including net income (loss) and its components, to assess performance, allocate resources and guide strategic decisions. For further information regarding the accounting policies of our reportable segments, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of our Annual Report. The tables below present information about our segments.

Our Senior Living Communities Managed by Five Star.
Five Star managed

Business and Property Management Agreements with RMR
We have
no
employees. The personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR. We have
two
agreements with RMR to provide management services to us: (1) a business management agreement, which relates to our business generally; and (2) a property management agreement, which relates to the property level operations of many of our properties, including our medical office and life science properties, and major renovation or repositioning activities at our senior living communities that we may request RMR to manage from time to time. See Note 11 for further information regarding our relationship, agreements and transactions with RMR.
Business Management Agreements with RMR.
Pursuant to our business management agreement and in accordance with GAAP, we accrued estimated incentive management fees during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The actual amount of incentive management fees incurred for 2025, if any, will be based on our common share total return, as defined in our business management agreement, for the three year period ending December 31, 2025, and will be payable to RMR in January 2026. We did not incur any incentive management fees for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Expense Reimbursement.
We are generally responsible for all our operating expenses, including certain expenses incurred or arranged by RMR on our behalf. We are generally not responsible for payment of RMR's employment, office or administrative expenses incurred to provide management services to us, except for the employment and related expenses of RMR's employees assigned to work exclusively or partly at our properties, our share of the wages, benefits and other related
17

costs of RMR's centralized accounting personnel, our share of RMR's costs for providing our internal audit function, or as otherwise agreed. Our property level operating expenses are generally incorporated into the rents charged to our tenants, including certain payroll and related costs incurred by RMR.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the business management fees, incentive management fees, property management fees and construction supervision fees and expense reimbursements recognized in our condensed consolidated financial statements were as follows:

In January 2025, in connection with a $
100,000
credit agreement and related security agreement entered into by RMR and certain of its subsidiaries with Citibank, N.A., or Citibank, and the other lenders party thereto, we consented to the pledge and assignment of RMR’s interest in our management agreements under the security agreement. Pursuant to the consent, we agreed, among other things, that upon notice that an event of default under the RMR credit agreement has occurred and is continuing, we will continue to make all payments under our management agreements in accordance with the instructions of Citibank, and that if there is an event of default by RMR under our management agreements that would allow us to terminate or suspend our obligations, we will not terminate or suspend without notice to Citibank and provide Citibank
30
days to cure the default on RMR’s behalf. The consent was approved by our Independent Trustees.
Management Agreements between our Joint Ventures and RMR.
We have
two
separate joint venture arrangements with third party institutional investors, the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV. RMR provides management services to both of these joint ventures. Our joint ventures are not our consolidated subsidiaries and, as a result, we are not obligated to pay management fees to RMR under our management agreements with RMR for the services it provides regarding the joint ventures.
Note 11.
Related Person Transactions
We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR, RMR Inc., AlerisLife (including Five Star), and others related to them, including other companies to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services and some of which have trustees, directors or officers who are also our Trustees or officers. RMR is a majority owned subsidiary of RMR Inc. The Chair of our Board of Trustees and one of our Managing Trustees, Adam Portnoy, is the sole trustee, an officer and the

AlerisLife.
On February 16, 2024, we exercised our purchase right in connection with ABP Trust's acquisition of AlerisLife in March 2023 and acquired, together with our applicable TRS, approximately
34.0
% of the then outstanding AlerisLife common shares from ABP Trust, for a total purchase price of $
15,459

66.0
% of AlerisLife.
On February 14, 2025, AlerisLife paid an aggregate cash dividend of $
50,000
to its stockholders. Our pro rata share of this cash dividend was $
17,000
.
See Note 9 for further information regarding our relationships, agreements and transactions with AlerisLife (including Five Star).

107
and $
109
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
For further information about these and other such relationships and certain other related person transactions, see our Annual Report.
Note 12.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including the impact of changes in interest rates. The only risk currently managed by us using derivative instruments is our interest rate risk. As required under the applicable loan agreement, we have an interest rate cap agreement to manage our interest rate risk exposure on our $
140,000
floating rate mortgage loan secured by
14
SHOP communities with interest payable at a rate equal to SOFR plus a premium of
2.50
%. The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements. To mitigate this risk, we only enter into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which we or our related parties may also have other financial relationships. We do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.

(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
Our interest rate cap agreement is designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk and is measured on a recurring basis at fair value. See Notes 5 and 6 for further information regarding the debt our interest rate cap is related to and the fair value of our interest rate cap.
The following table summarizes the terms of our outstanding interest rate cap agreement as of March 31, 2025:

Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. For derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with our accounting policy election. The earnings recognition of excluded components is presented in interest expense. Amounts reported in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made, if any, on our applicable debt.

Note 13.
Income Taxes
We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and, as such, are generally not subject to federal and most state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements. We do, however, lease our managed senior living communities to our wholly owned TRSs that, unlike most of our subsidiaries, file a separate consolidated federal corporate income tax return and are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our consolidated income tax provision includes the income tax provision related to the operations of our TRSs and certain state income taxes we incur despite our taxation as a REIT. Our current income tax expense (or benefit) fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our income, including gains on the disposition of properties or losses in a particular quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we recognized income tax expense of $
49
and $
187
, respectively.
Note 14.
Weighted Average Common Share
s
We calculate basic earnings per common share using the two class method. We calculate diluted earnings per share using the more dilutive of the two class method or the treasury stock method. Unvested share awards and other potentially dilutive common shares, together with the related impact on earnings, are considered when calculating diluted earnings per share.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report.
OVERVIEW
We are a REIT organized under Maryland law that primarily owns medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties throughout the United States. As of March 31, 2025, we owned 343 properties located in 34 states and Washington, D.C., including 11 properties classified as held for sale and two closed senior living communities.
As of March 31, 2025, we owned an equity interest in each of the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV that own medical office and life science properties located in five states with an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet that were 99% leased with an average (by annualized rental income) remaining lease term of 14.9 years.
We are encouraged by positive trends, including increases in rates, margins and occupancy, in our SHOP segment. Additionally, we expect that favorable supply and demand dynamics in the senior living industry will enable our managers to continue to grow occupancy and drive positive performance. While certain costs, primarily labor, insurance and food costs, have increased, we expect these cost increases to moderate, which will provide our managers the opportunity to increase rates in excess of increases in costs, resulting in improving returns to us.
In an effort to optimize performance, our asset management team reviews the results of each of our senior living communities and our operators, taking into account various factors such as performance metric benchmarks, location and other relevant data points. This comprehensive review process ensures that our decisions are data-driven and strategically aligned with our overall objectives. As a result of these reviews, our strategy to drive positive performance includes analyzing non-performing communities for potential disposition or transition to different operators.
We are closely monitoring the impacts of the current economic and market conditions on all aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, uncertainties surrounding interest rates and inflation, volatility in the public debt and equity markets, global geopolitical hostilities and tensions, economic uncertainties and tariffs, labor market conditions and changes in real estate utilization. We expect to experience continued variability in labor, insurance and food costs in our SHOP segment. Inflationary pressures in the United States, as well as global geopolitical instability and tensions, have given rise to uncertainty regarding potential disruptions in the financial markets. Continued or intensified disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our financial condition and that of our managers, operators and tenants, could adversely impact the ability or willingness of our managers, operators, tenants or residents to pay amounts owed to us, could impair our ability to effectively deploy our capital or realize our target returns on our investments, may restrict our access to, and would likely increase, our cost of capital, and may cause the values of our properties and of our securities to decline.
For further information and risks relating to these economic uncertainties and their impact on our business and financial condition, see Part I, Item 1, "Business" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars and square feet in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
We operate in, and report financial information for, the following two segments: Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and SHOP. Our Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio segment primarily consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties primarily leased to biotech laboratories and other similar tenants. Our SHOP segment consists of managed senior living communities that provide short term and long term residential living and, in some instances, care and other services for residents where we pay fees to managers to operate the communities on our behalf.
We also report “All Other” operations, which consists of triple net leased wellness centers and senior living communities that are leased to third party operators from which we receive rents, which we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reportable segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reportable segment.
The following table summarizes the results of operations of each of our segments for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:

Consists of medical office and life science properties that we have owned and which have been in service continuously since January 1, 2024; excludes properties classified as held for sale or out of service undergoing redevelopment, if any, and properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in each of which we own an equity interest.
Rental income.
Rental income increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in property operating expense reimbursements at certain of our properties and a termination fee totaling $600 paid during the three months ended March 31, 2025 by a former tenant at one of our properties. This space was subsequently re-leased to another tenant in April 2025. The increase in rental income at our comparable properties was partially offset by decreased transient parking at one of our properties. Rental
25
income decreased at our non-comparable properties primarily due to dispositions since January 1, 2024 and vacancies at two of our properties classified as held for sale.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, management fees, salaries and benefit costs of property level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these properties. The increase in property operating expenses at our comparable properties is primarily due to an increase in snow removal expenses, repairs and maintenance and utilities due to increases in usage and rates at certain of our properties. The increases in property operating expenses at our comparable properties were partially offset by a decrease in real estate taxes at certain of our properties due to refunds realized and a reduction in assessed values as a result of successful appeals during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Property operating expenses decreased at our non-comparable properties primarily due to dispositions since January 1, 2024.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.

Consists of senior living communities that we have owned and which have been in service, reported in the same segment and operated by the same operator continuously since January 1, 2024; excludes communities classified as held for sale, closed or out of service, if any.
(2)
Average monthly rate reflects the average monthly residents fees and services per occupied unit for the period presented. The average monthly rate is calculated based on the actual number of days during the period.
Residents fees and services.
Residents fees and services are the revenues earned at our managed senior living communities. We recognize these revenues as services are provided and related fees are accrued. Residents fees and services increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in occupancy and average monthly rate at our communities as shown in the table above. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the five communities classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2025 and the 13 communities transitioned to an existing third party manager during the 2024 period.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, wages and benefit costs of community level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, management fees, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these communities. Property operating expenses increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in labor costs, management fees as a result of higher revenues, utilities, marketing, real estate taxes and other direct costs, partially offset by reduced insurance costs due to a reduction in premiums. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the five communities classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2025 and the 13 communities transitioned to an existing third party manager during the 2024 period.

All Other operations consist of all of our other operations, including certain wellness centers and senior living communities that are leased to third party operators, which segment we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reportable segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reportable segment.

Consists of properties that we have owned and which have been reported in the same segment and leased to the same operator continuously since January 1, 2024; excludes properties classified as held for sale, if any.

All tenant operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the most recent prior period for which tenant operating results are available to us. Rent coverage is calculated using the annualized operating cash flows from our triple net lease tenants' operations of our properties, before subordinated charges, if any, divided by annualized rental income. We have not independently verified tenant operating data. Excludes data for historical periods prior to our ownership of certain properties.
Rental income.
Rental income increased at our comparable properties primarily due to new leases for one of our wellness center tenants. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 18 triple net leased senior living communities that we sold in February 2025.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses that are not paid directly by our tenants. The decrease in property operating expenses for our comparable properties primarily reflects real estate taxes and other expenses paid directly by our tenants during the three months ended March 31, 2025, which were previously paid by us during prior periods.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.
Consolidated
:
Depreciation and amortization expense.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to dispositions since January 1, 2024 and certain depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by the purchase of capital improvements at certain of our properties.
General and administrative expense
. General and administrative expense consists of fees paid to RMR under our business management agreement, legal and accounting fees, fees and expenses of our Trustees, equity compensation expense and other costs relating to our status as a publicly traded company. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to $2,407 of estimated incentive management fees that we recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $849 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as a result of our total shareholder return exceeding the returns for the MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care REIT Index over the applicable measurement period.
Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs.
Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs primarily represent costs incurred with acquisitions and non-recurring transactions that we expensed under GAAP.
27
Impairment of assets.
For information about our asset impairment charges, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of our Annual Report.
Gain (loss) on sale of properties.
For information regarding gain (loss) on sale of properties, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Gain on insurance recoveries.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recognized a gain on insurance recoveries related to cash received from our insurance provider in excess of our losses for a claim that was finalized. For further information regarding this gain on insurance recoveries, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Interest and other income.
The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to lower average invested cash balances during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the 2024 period.
Interest expense.
Interest expense increased primarily due to the execution of a $120,000 mortgage loan in May 2024 at a fixed interest rate of 6.864% per annum and an increase in the discount accretion for our senior secured notes due 2026. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we recognized discount accretion of $22,122 and $20,659, respectively, for our senior secured notes due 2026. These increases were partially offset by the redemption during 2024 of an aggregate $120,000 of our outstanding 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025.
Loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the partial redemption of an aggregate $299,158 of our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026.
Income tax expense
. Income tax expense is the result of operating income we earned in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes.
Equity in net earnings of investees.
Equity in net earnings of investees is the change in the fair value of our investments in our joint ventures and also represents our proportionate share of the earnings of our equity method investment in AlerisLife. For further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife, see Notes 3 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
28
Non-GAAP Financial Measures (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
We present certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including funds from operations, or FFO, normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, and NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties.
Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations
We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of FFO of our equity method investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items shown below, including similar adjustments for our unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and incentive management fees, if any. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing our debt, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.
Our calculations of FFO and Normalized FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and reconciliations of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements, to FFO and Normalized FFO appear in the following table. This table also provides a comparison of distributions to shareholders, FFO and Normalized FFO and net income (loss) per share for these periods.

Incentive management fees are estimated and accrued for during the applicable measuring period. Actual incentive management fees will be calculated based on common share total return, as defined in our business management agreement, for the three-year period ending December 31 for the applicable calendar year, are included in general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and will be payable to RMR in January of the following calendar year. In calculating net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, we recognize estimated incentive management fees expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters. Although we recognize this expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters for purposes of calculating net income (loss), we do not include these amounts in the calculation of Normalized FFO until the fourth quarter, when the amount of the incentive management fees expense for the calendar year, if any, is determined.
Property Net Operating Income (NOI)
We calculate NOI as shown below. The calculation of NOI excludes certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level results of operations. We define NOI as income from our real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization. We use NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI differently than we do.

The calculation of NOI by reportable segment is included above in this Item 2. The following table includes the reconciliation of net loss to NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in thousands)
Our principal sources of cash to meet operating and capital expenses, pay our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders are the operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our leased properties, residents fees and services revenues from our managed communities and proceeds from the disposition of certain properties. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, pay our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon:
•
our ability to receive rents from our tenants;
•
our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy of, and the rates at, our properties;
•
our and our managers' abilities to control operating expenses and capital expenses at our properties, including increased operating expenses that we may incur in response to wage and commodity price inflation, limited labor availability and increased insurance costs; and
•
our managers' abilities to maintain or increase our returns from our managed senior living communities.

Our Operating Liquidity and Resources
We generally receive minimum rents from tenants at our medical office and life science properties, triple net leased wellness centers and senior living communities monthly, we receive residents fees and services revenues, net of expenses, from our managed senior living communities monthly and we receive percentage rents from tenants at certain of our triple net senior living communities monthly, quarterly or annually.
The change in cash (used in) provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior period was primarily due to the accreted interest of $34,700 paid during the 2025 period as a result of the partial redemption of our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026.
Our Investing Liquidity and Resources
The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior period was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of properties, a $17,000 cash dividend paid to us by AlerisLife, our purchase on February 16, 2024 of approximately 34.0% of the then outstanding AlerisLife common shares from ABP Trust at the tender offer price of $1.31 per share for a total purchase price, including transaction related costs, of $15,459 and a decrease in real estate improvements. These changes were partially offset by $5,800 of contributions made to the Seaport JV.

We generally plan to continue investing capital in our properties, including redevelopment projects, to better position these properties in their respective markets in order to increase our returns in future years.
As of March 31, 2025, we had estimated unspent leasing related obligations at our medical office and life science properties of approximately $28,429, of which we expect to spend approximately $23,627 during the next 12 months. We expect to fund these obligations using operating cash flows, cash on hand, proceeds from the disposition of certain properties and future financing activities.
We are currently in the process of redeveloping certain properties, primarily our managed senior living communities. We continue to assess opportunities to redevelop other properties in our SHOP segment and Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio. These redevelopment projects may require significant capital expenditures and time to complete and we may defer certain redevelopment projects to preserve liquidity. Additionally, due to labor availability constraints and wage and commodity price inflation, the capital investments we plan to make may be delayed or cost more than we expect.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we sold 24 properties for an aggregate sales price of $320,825, excluding closing costs. Subsequent to March 31, 2025, we sold one property for a sales price of $11,150, excluding closing costs. As of May 2, 2025, we had 19 properties under agreements or letters of intent to sell for an aggregate sales price of $115,773, excluding closing costs. The net proceeds from the sales of two of these properties, which have an expected aggregate sales price, excluding closing costs, of $13,118, are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026, if the sales of such properties are completed. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result. For further information regarding

our dispositions, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On February 14, 2025, AlerisLife paid an aggregate cash dividend of $50,000 to its stockholders. Our pro rata share of this cash dividend was $17,000.
Our Financing Liquidity and Resources
The change in cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the prior period was primarily due to the partial redemption of our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026, partially offset by our execution of a $140,000 mortgage loan in the 2025 period.
As of March 31, 2025, we had $302,577 of cash and cash equivalents. We typically use cash balances, net proceeds from offerings of securities, debt issuances or dispositions of assets and cash flows from our operations to fund our operations, debt repayments, distributions, acquisitions, investments, capital expenditures and other general business purposes.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we paid a quarterly cash distribution to our shareholders totaling approximately $2,413 using existing cash balances. On April 10, 2025, we declared a quarterly distribution payable to common shareholders of record on April 22, 2025 in the amount of $0.01 per share, or approximately $2,413. We expect to pay this distribution on or about May 15, 2025 using cash on hand. For further information regarding the distribution we paid during 2025, see Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
We believe we may have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund our operations and repay our debts and other obligations as they become due. Our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt or equity transactions depends primarily upon market conditions and our then creditworthiness and our ability to be in compliance with our debt covenants. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit and debt ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, our liquidity position, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully carry out that intention. A protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage and commodity price inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, economic downturns and a possible recession, may have various negative consequences including a decline in financing availability and increased costs for financing. Further, those conditions could also disrupt capital markets and limit our access to financing from public sources, particularly if the global financial markets experience significant disruptions.
Our $641,376 in outstanding senior secured notes due 2026 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and senior secured basis, by the Collateral Guarantors, and on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all our subsidiaries other than the Collateral Guarantors and certain excluded subsidiaries. These notes and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in each of the collateral properties and 100% of the equity interests in each of the Collateral Guarantors. No cash interest will accrue on these notes prior to maturity. The accreted value of these notes will increase at a rate of 11.25% per annum compounded semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. We have a one-time option to extend the maturity date of these senior secured notes by one year, to January 15, 2027, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. If we exercise this option, interest payments will be due semiannually during the extension period at an initial interest rate of 11.25% with increases of 50 basis points every 90 days these senior secured notes remain outstanding. We are currently under letters of intent to sell two additional properties securing our senior secured notes due 2026 for an aggregate sales price of $13,118, excluding closing costs. The net proceeds from these sales are required to be used to partially redeem these senior secured notes, if these sales are completed.
In March 2025, we executed a $140,000 floating rate mortgage loan secured by 14 SHOP communities. This mortgage loan matures in March 2028 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a premium of 2.50% with interest-only payments through March 2027, and we have two six-month extension options of the interest-only period, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. In connection with this mortgage loan, we have purchased an interest rate cap with a SOFR strike rate equal to 4.50% pursuant to the terms of the applicable loan agreement. The net proceeds from this mortgage loan were
34
Table of Contents
approximately $136,228 after deducting estimated closing costs, and in April 2025, we used these proceeds and cash on hand to partially redeem $140,000 of our then outstanding 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025.
In April 2025, we executed a $108,873 fixed rate mortgage loan secured by seven SHOP communities. This mortgage loan matures in May 2035 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.22%, with interest-only payments through May 2030. Also in April 2025, we provided notice to the holders of our 9.75% senior unsecured notes due June 2025 to redeem $140,000 of these notes in May 2025 using these loan proceeds and cash on hand. Additionally, we have executed term sheets with additional lenders for expected aggregate proceeds of $94,030 for loans that will be secured by an aggregate of six SHOP communities. We intend to use these proceeds and cash on hand to fully redeem the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 9.75% senior unsecured notes due in June 2025, which is our next significant debt maturity. The closings of the additional loans are subject to conditions; accordingly, we cannot be sure if we will close such loans for the expected proceeds or at all or that these closings will not be delayed.
For further information regarding our outstanding debt, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Debt Covenants (dollars in thousands)
Our principal debt obligations at March 31, 2025 were: (1) $1,980,000 outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured notes; (2) $641,376 outstanding principal amount of senior secured notes; and (3) $267,044 aggregate principal amount of mortgage notes (excluding discounts, premiums and net debt issuance costs) secured by 23 properties. For further information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Our senior notes are governed by our senior notes indentures and their supplements. Our senior notes indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. Our senior notes indentures and their supplements also contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts and require us to maintain various financial ratios. As of March 31, 2025, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our senior notes indentures and their supplements and our other debt obligations. Although we continue to take steps to enhance our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, as noted elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage or commodity price inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, economic downturns or a possible recession, may cause increased pressure on our ability to satisfy financial and other covenants. If our operating results and financial condition are significantly negatively impacted by economic conditions or otherwise, we may fail to satisfy our debt covenants and conditions.
Our senior notes indentures and their supplements do not contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. See "—Our Financing Liquidity and Resources" above for information regarding recent changes to our issuer credit rating and senior debt ratings.
Our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of more than $20,000 ($50,000 or more in the case of our senior notes indentures and supplements entered in February 2016, February 2018, June 2020, February 2021 and December 2023).
The loan agreements governing the aggregate $620,000 secured debt financing related to the Seaport JV contain customary covenants and provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. We no longer include this $620,000 of secured debt financing in our condensed consolidated balance sheet following the deconsolidation of the net assets of this joint venture; however, we continue to provide certain guaranties on this debt. The debt secured by the properties included in the LSMD JV in which we own a 20% equity interest is guaranteed by this joint venture and is non-recourse to us.
Supplemental Guarantor Information (dollars in thousands)
On May 28, 2020, we issued $1,000,000 of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025. We subsequently redeemed $500,000, $120,000 and $140,000 of this debt during 2022, 2024 and 2025 respectively, with $240,000 remaining outstanding as of May 2, 2025. On February 3, 2021, we issued $500,000 of our 4.375% senior notes due 2031. As of March 31, 2025, all $380,000 of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and all $500,000 of our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries except certain excluded subsidiaries. The notes
35
Table of Contents
and related guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the applicable collateral, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining $1,100,000 of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees.
A subsidiary guarantor's guarantee of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, as applicable, and all other obligations of such subsidiary guarantor under the indenture governing the notes will automatically terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will automatically be released from all of its obligations under such subsidiary guarantee and the indenture under certain circumstances, including on or after the date (a) the notes have an investment grade rating from two rating agencies and one of such investment grade ratings is a mid-BBB investment grade rating and (b) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 or our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 or the respective guarantees, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. The rights of holders of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, as applicable, to benefit from any of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries are subject to the prior satisfaction of claims of those subsidiaries' creditors and any preferred equity holders. As a result, our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 and the respective guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, including guarantees of other indebtedness of ours, payment obligations under lease agreements, trade payables and preferred equity.
The following tables present summarized financial information for guarantor entities and issuer, on a combined basis after eliminating (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantor entities and (ii) equity in earnings from, and any investments in, any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor:

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairments of real estate and intangible assets.
A discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since the year ended December 31, 2024.
Impact of Government Reimbursement
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, substantially all of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from our tenants' and residents' private resources, and a small amount of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from Medicare and Medicaid payments. Nonetheless, we own, and our tenants, managers and operators operate, facilities in many states that participate in federal and state healthcare payment programs, including the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare payment programs. Also, some of our medical office and life science property tenants participate in federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other government healthcare payment programs.
For more information regarding the government healthcare funding and regulation of our business, please see the section captioned “Business—Government Regulation and Reimbursement” in our Annual Report and the section captioned “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Government Reimbursement” in our Annual Report.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives, including fixed rate debt, and employing derivative instruments, including interest rate caps, to limit our exposure to increasing interest rates. Other than as described below, we do not currently expect any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future.
Floating Rate Debt

Monthly
(1)
The annual interest rate is the rate stated in the applicable contract, as adjusted by our interest rate cap.
Our $140,000 floating rate mortgage loan is subject to two, one-year extension options and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of SOFR plus a premium of 2.50%. We are vulnerable to changes in the U.S. dollar based on short term interest rates, specifically SOFR. In connection with this mortgage loan, to hedge our exposure to risks related to changes in SOFR and pursuant to the terms of the applicable loan agreement, we have purchased an interest rate cap with a SOFR strike rate equal to 4.50%.
37
Table of Contents
In addition, upon renewal or refinancing of these obligations, we are vulnerable to increases in interest rate premiums, including increases in the cost of replacement interest rate caps, due to market conditions and our perceived credit risk. The following table presents the approximate impact a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at March 31, 2025, including the impact of our interest rate cap:

Based on the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2025.
(2)
A one percentage point increase in interest rates would be capped at 7.00% for our floating rate debt as a result of our 4.50% interest rate cap purchased for our $140,000 floating rate mortgage loan. However, a one percentage point increase in the interest rate of our floating rate debt to 7.82% at March 31, 2025 would result in total floating rate interest expense per year of $11,107 and a decrease in annual earnings per share of $0.05.
The foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate one percentage point change in floating interest rates, including the impact of our interest rate cap. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amounts of any floating rate debt we may incur and the impact, if any, of interest rate caps we may purchase. Generally, if interest rates were to change gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time.
Fixed Rate Debt
There have been no material changes to market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt during the three months ended March 31, 2025. For a discussion of market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" included in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
