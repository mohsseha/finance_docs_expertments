(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
Note 1.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Diversified Healthcare Trust and its subsidiaries, or we, us, or our, are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or our Annual Report.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim period have been included. All intercompany transactions and balances with or among our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairments of real estate and intangible assets.
We have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be involved in claims, lawsuits, and regulatory and other governmental audits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain, we do not believe any currently pending litigation or proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 2.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, or ASU No. 2023-07, which requires public entities to: (i) provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items if they are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, or the CODM, and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss; (ii) provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280,
Segment Reporting
, or ASC 280, in interim periods; and (iii) disclose the CODM’s title and position, as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures and other disclosures. Public entities with a single reportable segment must apply all the disclosure requirements of ASU No. 2023-07, as well as all the existing segment disclosures under ASC 280. The amendments in ASU No. 2023-07 are incremental to the requirements in ASC 280 and do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. ASU No. 2023-07 should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We expect to include additional disclosures as a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2023-07; however, these changes are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, or ASU No. 2023-09, which requires public entities to enhance their annual income tax disclosures by requiring: (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 should be applied prospectively but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We expect to include additional disclosures in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2023-09; however, these changes are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Real Estate and Other Investments
As of September 30, 2024, we owned
368
properties located in
36
states and Washington, D.C., including
25
properties classified as held for sale and
three
closed senior living communities, and we owned an equity interest in each of
two
unconsolidated joint ventures that own medical office and life science properties located in
five
states.
Acquisitions and Dispositions:
We did
not
acquire any properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold
four
properties for an aggregate sales price of $
29,075
, excluding closing costs, as presented in the table below. The sales of these properties do not represent a significant disposition and we do not believe these sales represent a strategic shift in our business. As a result, the results of operations for these properties are included in continuing operations through the date of sale of such properties in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

28
properties under agreements or letters of intent to sell for an aggregate sales price of $
348,080
, excluding closing costs. If these sales are completed, approximately $
302,100
of the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result.
Impairment:
We regularly evaluate our assets for indicators of impairment. Impairment indicators may include declining tenant or resident occupancy, weak or declining profitability from the property, decreasing tenant cash flows or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life, and legislative, market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of an asset. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the affected assets by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from those assets. The future cash flows are subjective and are based in part on assumptions regarding hold periods, market rents and terminal capitalization rates. If the
8
Table of Contents
DIVERSIFIED HEALTHCARE TRUST
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of $
27,173
related to
one
medical office property and
one
life science property that were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. We also recorded impairment charges of $

two
medical office properties that were sold in 2024.

620,000
is expected to be repaid. This mortgage loan matures on November 6, 2028 and any unpaid principal from the anticipated repayment date through the maturity date bears interest at a variable rate of the greater of

medical office and life science properties in which we own a
20
% equity interest, or the LSMD JV, and the unconsolidated joint venture for a life science property located in Boston, Massachusetts in which we own a
10
% equity interest, or the Seaport JV, using the equity method of accounting under the fair value option. We recognized changes in the fair value of our investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures of $
1,707
and $(
145
) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $(
18,173
) and $
2,137
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in equity in net earnings (losses) of investees in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 6 for further information regarding the valuation of our investment in these joint ventures.
Equity Method Investment in AlerisLife:
As of September 30, 2024, we owned approximately
34.0
% of the outstanding common shares of AlerisLife Inc., or AlerisLife. We account for our
34.0
% non-controlling interest in AlerisLife using the equity method of accounting.
As of September 30, 2024, our investment in AlerisLife had a carrying value of $
23,758
. The cost basis of our investment in AlerisLife exceeded our proportionate share of AlerisLife's total stockholders' equity book value on the date of acquisition of our initial interest in AlerisLife, which was February 16, 2024, by an aggregate of $
29,500
. As required under GAAP, we are amortizing this difference to equity in earnings of an investee over 21 years, the weighted average remaining useful life of the real estate assets owned by AlerisLife and the intangible contract asset with us as of the date of acquisition. We recorded
9

(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
amortization of the basis difference of $
351
and $
877
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We recognized income of $(
1,531
) and $
7,414
related to our investment in AlerisLife for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These amounts are included in equity in net earnings (losses) of investees in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 11 for further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife.
Note 4.
Leases
We are a lessor of medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties. Our leases provide our tenants with the contractual right to use and economically benefit from all of the premises demised under the leases; therefore, we have determined to evaluate our leases as lease arrangements.
Our leases provide for base rent payments and, in addition, may include variable payments. Rental income from operating leases, including any payments derived by index or market based indices, is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term when we have determined that the collectability of substantially all of the lease payments is probable. Some of our leases have options to extend or terminate the lease exercisable at the option of our tenants, which are considered when determining the lease term.
We increased rental income to record revenue on a straight line basis by $
658
and $
676
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
1,605
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We decreased rental income to record revenue on a straight line basis by $
1,333
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Rents receivable, excluding receivables related to our properties classified as held for sale, if any, include $
74,088
and $
75,306
of straight line rent receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in other assets, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We do not include in our measurement of our lease receivables certain variable payments, including changes in the index or market based indices after the inception of the lease, certain tenant reimbursements and other income until the specific events that trigger the variable payments have occurred. Such payments totaled $
11,126
and $
12,018
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which tenant reimbursements totaled $
11,083
and $
11,965
, respectively, and $
34,111
and $
36,579
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which tenant reimbursements totaled $
33,953
and $
36,414
, respectively.
Right of Use Asset and Lease Liability:
For leases where we are the lessee, we recognize a right of use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments with rental payments being applied to the lease liability and the right of use asset being amortized over the term of the lease. The values of the right of use assets and related liabilities representing our future obligation under the respective lease arrangements for which we are the lessee were $
20,868
and $
21,254
, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and $
23,366
and $
23,748
, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The right of use assets and related lease liabilities are included within
other assets, net
and
other liabilities
, respectively, within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we lease equipment at certain of our managed senior living communities. These leases are short term in nature, are cancelable with no fee or do not result in an annual expense in excess of our capitalization policy and, as a result, are not recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Note 5.
Indebtedness
Our principal debt obligations, excluding any debt obligations of our joint ventures, at September 30, 2024 were: (1) $
2,040,000
outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured notes; (2) $
940,534
outstanding principal amount of senior secured notes with an aggregate net book value of $
1,070,598
; and (3) $
127,889
principal amount of mortgage debt secured by
nine
properties. The mortgaged properties had an aggregate net book value of $
205,750
at September 30, 2024. We also had
two
properties subject to finance leases that expire in 2026 with lease obligations totaling $
2,743
at September 30, 2024; these
two
properties had an aggregate net book value of $
21,815
at September 30, 2024.

(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise stated)
Until its repayment in full and termination on December 21, 2023, we had a $
450,000
credit facility that was fully drawn. The weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings under our former credit facility was
8.3
% and
7.8
% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In January 2023, we repaid $
113,627
in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility and the commitments were reduced to $
586,373
. In February 2023, we reduced the commitments from $
586,373
to $
450,000
following our repayment of $
136,373
in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility. As a result of the February 2023 reduction in commitments, we recorded a loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt of $
1,075
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
In May 2024, we executed a $
120,000
fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by
eight
medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of
6.864
%.
In June 2024, we redeemed $
60,000
of our outstanding
9.75
% senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the $
120,000
mortgage loan executed in May 2024. As a result of this redemption, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $
209
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
As of September 30, 2024, all $
940,534
of our senior secured notes due 2026 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and senior secured basis, by certain of our subsidiaries that own
95
properties, or the Collateral Guarantors, and on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all our subsidiaries other than the Collateral Guarantors and certain excluded subsidiaries, and all $
440,000
of our
9.75
% senior notes due 2025 and all $
500,000
of our
4.375
% senior notes due 2031 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries except certain excluded subsidiaries. The notes and related guarantees (other than our senior secured notes and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors) are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the applicable collateral, and the notes and related guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining $
1,100,000
of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees as of September 30, 2024. We are currently under agreements or letters of intent to sell
22
of the properties securing our senior secured notes due 2026 for an aggregate sales price of $
302,100
, excluding closing costs. If these sales are completed, the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026.
Our senior secured notes due 2026 and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in each of the collateral properties and
100
% of the equity interests in each of the Collateral Guarantors. No cash interest will accrue on these notes prior to maturity. The accreted value of these notes will increase at a rate of
11.25
% per annum compounded semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount at maturity. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized discount accretion of $
22,034
and $
64,133
, respectively, for our senior secured notes due 2026 in interest expense in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We have a one-time option to extend the maturity date of these notes by
one year
, to January 15, 2027, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of an extension fee. If we exercise this option, interest payments will be due semiannually during the extension period at an initial interest rate of
11.25
% with increases of
50
basis points every 90 days these notes remain outstanding.
Based on the significant number of unencumbered properties in our senior housing operating portfolio, or SHOP, segment and our demonstrated ability to execute debt financings, we believe we will likely be able to obtain additional debt financing that will allow us to satisfy the $
440,000
outstanding principal amount of our
9.75
% senior unsecured notes due June 2025.

We assumed certain of these secured debts in connection with our acquisition of certain properties. We recorded the assumed mortgage notes at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and we are amortizing the fair value adjustments, if any, to interest expense over the respective terms of the mortgage notes to adjust interest expense to the estimated market interest rates as of the date of acquisition.

We estimated the fair values of our
two
issuances of senior unsecured notes due 2042 and 2046 based on the closing price on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (Level 1 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). We estimated the fair values of our
three
issuances of senior unsecured notes due 2025, 2028 and 2031 and our issuance of senior secured notes due 2026 using an average of the bid and ask price on Nasdaq on or about September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). We estimated the fair values of our secured debts by using discounted cash flows analyses and currently prevailing market terms as of the measurement date (Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy under GAAP). Because Level 3 inputs are unobservable, our estimated fair values may differ materially from the actual fair values.

Segment Reporting
We operate in, and report financial information for, the following
two
segments: Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and SHOP. We aggregate the operating results of our properties in these
two
reporting segments based on their similar operating and economic characteristics. Our Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio segment primarily consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties primarily leased to biotech laboratories and other similar tenants. Our SHOP segment consists of managed senior living communities that provide short term and long term residential living and, in some instances, care and other services for residents where we pay fees to managers to operate the communities on our behalf.
We also report “non-segment” operations, which consists of triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators from which we receive rents, which we do not consider to be sufficiently material

Senior Living Community Management Agreements
Our managed senior living communities are operated by third parties pursuant to management agreements. Five Star Senior Living, or Five Star, which is an operating division of AlerisLife, manages many of our SHOP communities. Five Star manages these communities for us pursuant to a master management agreement. AlerisLife guarantees the payment and performance of each of its applicable subsidiary's obligations under the applicable management agreements.
In connection with ABP Trust’s acquisition of AlerisLife on March 20, 2023, we amended the master management agreement with AlerisLife to eliminate any change of control default or event of default provisions. See Note 11 for further information regarding ABP Trust's acquisition of AlerisLife.
Our Senior Living Communities Managed by Five Star.
Five Star managed
119
of our senior living communities as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023. We lease our senior living communities that are managed by Five Star to our taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs.
We incurred management fees payable to Five Star of $
10,611
and $
10,058
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
31,462
and $
29,962
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $
10,060
and $
9,457
, respectively, of the total management fees were expensed to property operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and $
551
and $
601
, respectively, were capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $
30,053
and $
27,909
, respectively, of the total management fees were expensed to property operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and $
1,409
and $
2,053
, respectively, were capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amounts capitalized are being depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related capital assets.
We incurred fees of $
0
and $
1,213
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with respect to rehabilitation services Five Star provided at our senior living communities that are payable by us. These amounts are included in property operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
We lease space to Five Star at certain of our senior living communities, which, prior to June 17, 2024, Five Star used to provide certain outpatient rehabilitation and wellness services through the Ageility branded business. Beginning on June 17, 2024, Five Star subleases this space to a subsidiary of Fox Rehabilitation, which acquired the Ageility branded business from AlerisLife on that date.
Our Senior Living Communities Managed by Other Third Party Managers.
Several other third party managers managed
111
of our senior living communities as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023. We lease our senior living communities that are managed by these third party managers to our TRSs.
In March 2024, we terminated our management agreement with one of our third party managers which manages certain of our communities located in Wisconsin and Illinois and transitioned these communities to another third party manager with which we have an existing relationship. The terms of the management agreement for these communities are generally consistent with the terms of the existing management agreements with our other third party managers. We paid transition costs, including termination and other fees, of $
2,042
related to the transition of these communities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
We incurred management fees payable to these third party managers of $
5,858
and $
5,635
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
17,341
and $
16,230
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in property operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Business and Property Management Agreements with RMR
We have
no
employees. The personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR. We have
two
agreements with RMR to provide management services to us: (1) a business management agreement, which relates to our business generally; and (2) a property management agreement, which relates to the property level operations of many of our properties, including our medical office and life science properties, and major renovation or repositioning activities at our senior living communities that we may request RMR to manage from time to time. See Note 11 for further information regarding our relationship, agreements and transactions with RMR.
We recognized net business management fees of $
11,249
and $
3,692
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
19,255
and $
10,283
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net business management fees we recognized for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include $
6,934
of estimated incentive fees based on our common share total return, as defined in our business management agreement. Although we recognized estimated incentive fees in accordance with GAAP, the actual amount of annual incentive fees for 2024, if any, will be based on our common share total return as defined in our business management agreement, for the
three-year
period ending December 31, 2024, and will be payable in January 2025. We did not incur any incentive fee payable for the year ended December 31, 2023. We recognize business management and incentive fees, if any, in general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
We recognized aggregate net property management and construction supervision fees of $
1,787
and $
2,209
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
5,411
and $
6,403
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $
1,358
and $
1,363
, respectively, of the total property management fees were expensed to property operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and $
429
and $
846
, respectively, were capitalized as building improvements in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, $
4,342
and $
4,226
, respectively, of the total property management fees were expensed to property operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and $
1,069
and $
2,177
, respectively, were capitalized as building improvements in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amounts capitalized are being depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related capital assets.
We are generally responsible for all our operating expenses, including certain expenses incurred or arranged by RMR on our behalf. We are generally not responsible for payment of RMR's employment, office or administrative expenses incurred to provide management services to us, except for the employment and related expenses of RMR's employees assigned to work exclusively or partly at our properties, our share of the wages, benefits and other related costs of RMR's centralized accounting personnel, our share of RMR's costs for providing our internal audit function, or as otherwise agreed. Our property level operating expenses are generally incorporated into the rents charged to our tenants, including certain payroll and related costs incurred by RMR. We reimbursed RMR $
4,007
and $
3,671
for these expenses and costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
11,448
and $
10,765
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in property operating expenses or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for these periods.
Management Agreements between our Joint Ventures and RMR.
We have
two
separate joint venture arrangements with third party institutional investors, the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV. RMR provides management services to both of these joint ventures. Our joint ventures are not our consolidated subsidiaries and, as a result, we are not obligated to pay management fees to RMR under our management agreements with RMR for the services it provides regarding the joint ventures.

In addition, officers of RMR and RMR Inc. serve as our officers and officers of other companies to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services. As of September 30, 2024, ABP Trust and Mr. Portnoy owned
9.8
% of our outstanding common shares.
AlerisLife.
Until March 20, 2023, we were AlerisLife's largest stockholder, owning approximately
31.9
% of AlerisLife's outstanding common shares, and ABP Acquisition LLC, or ABP Acquisition, a subsidiary of ABP Trust, together with ABP Trust, owned approximately
6.1
% of AlerisLife's outstanding common shares. Five Star is an operating division of AlerisLife. Five Star manages certain of the senior living communities we own. RMR provides management services to both us and AlerisLife.
On February 2, 2023, AlerisLife entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the ALR Merger Agreement, with certain subsidiaries of ABP Trust, pursuant to which ABP Trust acquired all of the publicly held outstanding AlerisLife common shares at a price of $
1.31
per share by tender offer.
In connection with the ALR Merger Agreement, on February 2, 2023, we agreed to tender all the AlerisLife common shares that we and our subsidiary then owned, into the tender offer at the tender offer price, subject to the right, but not the obligation, to purchase, on or before December 31, 2023, AlerisLife common shares at the tender offer price, and otherwise pursuant to a stockholders agreement to be entered into at the time of any such purchase. On December 20, 2023, we and ABP Trust extended our right to purchase AlerisLife common shares until March 31, 2024.
On February 16, 2024, we exercised this purchase right and acquired, together with our applicable TRS, approximately
34.0
% of the then outstanding AlerisLife common shares from ABP Trust at the tender offer price, for a total purchase price of $
14,890
, excluding transaction related costs, and we, our applicable TRS, ABP Trust and AlerisLife entered into a stockholders agreement. Following this acquisition, ABP Trust owns the remaining approximately
66.0
% of AlerisLife.
In connection with AlerisLife's sale of its Ageility branded business to a subsidiary of Fox Rehabilitation on June 17, 2024, we approved Five Star's sublease to a subsidiary of Fox Rehabilitation of space at certain of our senior living communities, which is used to provide certain outpatient rehabilitation and wellness services.
See Note 9 for further information regarding our relationships, agreements and transactions with AlerisLife (including Five Star).
Our Joint Ventures.
In connection with our entering into the LSMD JV in January 2022, we paid mortgage escrow amounts and closing costs that were payable by that joint venture. The remaining costs totaled $
6,080
as of September 30, 2024 and are included in other assets, net, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. RMR provides management services to each of the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV. See Note 10 for further information regarding those management agreements with RMR.

Note 12.
Income Taxes
We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and, as such, are generally not subject to federal and most state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements. We do, however, lease our managed senior living communities to our wholly owned TRSs that, unlike most of our subsidiaries, file a separate consolidated federal corporate income tax return and are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our consolidated income tax provision includes the income tax provision related to the operations of our TRSs and certain state income taxes we incur despite our taxation as a REIT. Our current income tax expense (or benefit) fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our income, including gains on the disposition of properties or losses in a particular quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized income tax expense of $
148
and $
189
, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized income tax expense of $
505
and $
379
, respectively.
Note 13.
Weighted Average Common Share
s
We calculate basic earnings per common share using the two class method. We calculate diluted earnings per share using the more dilutive of the two class method or the treasury stock method. Unvested share awards and other potentially dilutive common shares, together with the related impact on earnings, are considered when calculating diluted earnings per share.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report.
OVERVIEW
We are a REIT organized under Maryland law that primarily owns medical office and life science properties, senior living communities and other healthcare related properties throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 368 properties located in 36 states and Washington, D.C., including 25 properties classified as held for sale and three closed senior living communities. At September 30, 2024, the gross book value of our real estate assets at cost plus certain acquisition costs, before depreciation and purchase price allocations and less impairment write downs, was $7.2 billion.
As of September 30, 2024, we owned an equity interest in each of the Seaport JV and the LSMD JV that own medical office and life science properties located in five states with an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet that were 99% leased with an average (by annualized rental income) remaining lease term of 15.2 years.
We are closely monitoring the impacts of the current economic and market conditions on all aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, high interest rates, prolonged high inflation, labor market challenges, volatility in the public equity and debt markets, geopolitical risks, economic downturns or a possible recession and changes in real estate utilization. We expect to experience continued variability in labor, insurance and food costs in our SHOP segment.
In response to significant and prolonged increases in inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates in 2024, we cannot be sure that it will continue to do so, or that any future interest rate decreases will be significant, and interest rates may remain at the current high levels or increase. These inflationary pressures in the United States, as well as global geopolitical instability and tensions, have given rise to uncertainty regarding economic downturns or a possible recession and potential disruptions in the financial markets. An economic recession, or continued or intensified disruptions in the financial markets, could adversely affect our financial condition and that of our managers, operators and tenants, could adversely impact the ability or willingness of our managers, operators, tenants or residents to pay amounts owed to us, could impair our ability to effectively deploy our capital or realize our target returns on our investments, may restrict our access to, and would likely increase our cost of, capital, and may cause the values of our properties and of our securities to decline.
We are encouraged by positive trends, including increases in rates and occupancy, in our SHOP segment. Additionally, we expect that favorable supply and demand dynamics in the senior living industry will enable our managers to generate better returns at our communities than we experienced in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic. While certain costs, primarily labor, insurance and food costs, have increased, we expect these cost increases to moderate, which will provide our managers the opportunity to increase rates in excess of increases in costs, resulting in improving returns to us.
In an effort to optimize performance, our asset management team reviews the results of each of our senior living communities and our operators, taking into account various factors such as performance metric benchmarks, location and other relevant data points. This comprehensive review process ensures that our decisions are data-driven and strategically aligned with our overall objectives. As a result of these reviews, our strategy to drive positive performance includes analyzing non-performing communities for potential disposition or transition to different operators.
For further information and risks relating to these economic uncertainties, including changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on our business and financial condition, see Part I, Item 1, "Business" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars and square feet in thousands, unless otherwise noted)
We operate in, and report financial information for, the following two segments: Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and SHOP. We aggregate the operating results of our properties in these two reporting segments based on their similar operating and economic characteristics. Our Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio segment primarily consists of medical office properties leased to medical providers and other medical related businesses, as well as life science properties primarily leased to biotech laboratories and other similar tenants. Our SHOP segment consists of managed senior living communities that provide short term and long term residential living and, in some instances, care and other services for residents where we pay fees to managers to operate the communities on our behalf.
We also report “non-segment” operations, which consists of triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators from which we receive rents, which we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reporting segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reporting segment.
The following table summarizes the results of operations of each of our segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Consists of medical office and life science properties that we have owned and which have been in service continuously since July 1, 2023; excludes properties classified as held for sale or out of service undergoing redevelopment, if any, and properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in each of which we own an equity interest.
Rental income.
Rental income decreased at our comparable properties primarily due to vacancies at certain of our properties, partially offset by increases in property operating expense reimbursements at certain of our properties. Rental income decreased at our non-comparable properties primarily due to a vacancy at one of our properties classified as held for sale and dispositions since July 1, 2023, partially offset by a tenant default at one of our properties during the 2023 period.
26
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, management fees, salaries and benefit costs of property level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these properties. The decrease in property operating expenses at our comparable properties is primarily due to a decrease in real estate taxes due to refunds realized and a reduction in assessed values as a result of successful appeals during the 2024 period as well as decreases in repairs and maintenance and utility expenses, partially offset by increases in other direct costs. Property operating expenses decreased at our non-comparable properties primarily due to dispositions since July 1, 2023.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.

Consists of senior living communities that we have owned and which have been in service, reported in the same segment and operated by the same operator continuously since July 1, 2023; excludes communities classified as held for sale, closed or out of service, if any.
(2)
Average monthly rate reflects the average monthly residents fees and services per occupied unit for the period presented. The average monthly rate is calculated based on the actual number of days during the period.
Residents fees and services.
Residents fees and services are the revenues earned at our managed senior living communities. We recognize these revenues as services are provided and related fees are accrued. Residents fees and services increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in occupancy and average monthly rate at our communities as shown in the table above. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 13 communities transitioned to an existing third party manager during the 2024 period.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, utility expenses, insurance, wages and benefit costs of community level personnel, repairs and maintenance expense, management fees, cleaning expense and other direct costs of operating these communities. Property operating expenses increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increases in labor costs, repairs and maintenance, dietary expenses and other direct costs, partially offset by reduced contract labor, real estate taxes and insurance costs due to a reduction in premiums. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 13 communities transitioned to an existing third party manager during the 2024 period.

Non-segment operations consists of all of our other operations, including certain senior living communities and wellness centers that are leased to third party operators, which segment we do not consider to be sufficiently material to constitute a separate reporting segment, and any other income or expenses that are not attributable to a specific reporting segment.
(2)
Consists of properties that we have owned and which have been reported in the same segment and leased to the same operator continuously since July 1, 2023; excludes properties classified as held for sale, if any.
(3)
All tenant operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the most recent prior period for which tenant operating results are available to us. Rent coverage is calculated using the annualized operating cash flows from our triple net lease tenants' operations of our properties, before subordinated charges, if any, divided by annualized rental income. We have not independently verified tenant operating data. Excludes data for historical periods prior to our ownership of certain properties, as well as data for properties sold, closed or classified as held for sale, if any, or for which there was a transfer of operations during the periods presented.
Rental income.
Rental income increased at our comparable properties primarily due to a new lease at one of our wellness centers. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 18 triple net leased senior living communities classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024.
Property operating expenses.
Property operating expenses consist of real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses that are not paid directly by our tenants. The decrease in property operating expenses for our comparable properties primarily reflects real estate taxes and other expenses we paid during the 2023 period on behalf of a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. We also continue to pay real estate taxes and other expenses for one wellness center until the lease commences, which we expect to occur during the first quarter of 2025.
Net operating income.
The change in NOI reflects the net changes in rental income and property operating expenses described above.
Consolidated
:
Depreciation and amortization expense.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the purchase of capital improvements at certain of our properties, partially offset by certain depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated and dispositions since July 1, 2023.
General and administrative expense
. General and administrative expense consists of fees paid to RMR under our business management agreement, legal and accounting fees, fees and expenses of our Trustees, equity compensation expense and other costs relating to our status as a publicly traded company. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to $6,934 of estimated business management incentive fees that we recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of our total shareholder return exceeding the returns for the MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care REIT Index over the applicable measurement period and an increase in our business management fees of $622, as a result of an increase in average share price and weighted average debt, partially offset by a decrease in legal and other professional fees.
28
Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs.
Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs primarily represent costs incurred with acquisitions and non-recurring transactions that we expensed under GAAP. We incurred transition costs, including termination and other fees, during the 2024 period as a result of our transition of 13 communities to an existing third party manager. For more information about such transition of communities, see Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Impairment of assets.
For information about our asset impairment charges, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of our Annual Report.
Gain on sale of properties.
For information regarding gain on sale of properties, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Interest and other income.
The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to lower average invested cash balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.
Interest expense.
Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $940,534 of our senior secured notes due 2026 in December 2023, resulting in discount accretion of $22,034 during the 2024 period. Additionally, we executed a $120,000 mortgage loan in May 2024 at a fixed interest rate of 6.864% per annum. The increase was partially offset by the repayment and termination of our former credit facility and the redemption of $250,000 of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in May 2024. The net proceeds from our $940,534 senior secured notes due 2026 were used to make these repayments aggregating $700,000 in December 2023. Additionally, in June 2024, we redeemed $60,000 of our outstanding 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the $120,000 mortgage loan executed in May 2024.
Income tax expense
. Income tax expense is the result of operating income we earned in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes.
Equity in net earnings (losses) of investees.
Equity in net earnings (losses) of investees is the change in the fair value of our investments in our joint ventures and also represents our proportionate share of the earnings of our equity method investment in AlerisLife. For further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife, see Notes 3 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Rental income.
Rental income increased at our comparable properties primarily due to increased parking revenue at one of our properties and leasing activity, partially offset by vacancies at certain of our properties. Rental income decreased at our non-comparable properties primarily due to a vacancy at one of our properties classified as held for sale and dispositions since January 1, 2023, partially offset by a tenant default at one of our properties during the 2023 period and an increase in rental income at one of our recently redeveloped properties.
Property operating expenses.
The increase in property operating expenses at our comparable properties is primarily due to increased insurance costs recorded in the 2024 period and increases in utility expenses and cleaning costs, partially offset by a decrease in real estate taxes due to refunds realized and a reduction in assessed values as a result of successful appeals during the 2024 period. Property operating expenses decreased at our non-comparable properties primarily due to dispositions since January 1, 2023.

All tenant operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the most recent prior period for which tenant operating results are available to us. Rent coverage is calculated using the annualized operating cash flows from our triple net lease tenants' operations of our properties, before subordinated charges, if any, divided by annualized rental income. We have not independently verified tenant operating data.
Rental income.
Rental income decreased at our comparable properties primarily due to a cash settlement and higher cash rents received during the 2023 period from a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. In January 2023, we agreed to amend the lease for three of these wellness centers and repossess the remaining three wellness centers. The three wellness centers we repossessed were subsequently re-leased to other tenants. The activity for our non-comparable properties primarily reflects the 18 triple net leased senior living communities classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024.
Property operating expenses.
The decrease in property operating expenses for our comparable properties primarily reflects real estate taxes and other expenses we paid during the 2023 period on behalf of a tenant previously in default under leases for six of our wellness centers. We also continue to pay real estate taxes and other expenses for one wellness center until the lease commences, which we expect to occur during the first quarter of 2025.

Consolidated
:
Depreciation and amortization expense.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the purchase of capital improvements at certain of our properties, partially offset by certain depreciable assets becoming fully depreciated and dispositions since January 1, 2023.
General and administrative expense
. General and administrative expense increased primarily due to $6,934 of estimated business management incentive fees that we recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of our total shareholder return exceeding the returns for the MSCI U.S. REIT/Health Care REIT Index over the applicable measurement period and an increase in our business management fees of $2,038, as a result of an increase in average share price and weighted average debt, partially offset by a decrease in legal and other professional fees.
Acquisition and certain other transaction related costs.
We incurred transition costs, including termination and other fees, during the 2024 period as a result of our transition of 13 communities to an existing third party manager. For more information
32
about such transition of communities, see Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Impairment of assets.

The decrease in interest and other income is primarily due to lower average invested cash balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and $1,581 of funds we received from certain programs under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the American Rescue Plan Act and various state programs during the 2023 period.
Interest expense.
Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $940,534 of our senior secured notes due 2026 in December 2023, resulting in discount accretion of $64,133 during the 2024 period. Additionally, we executed a $120,000 mortgage loan in May 2024 at a fixed interest rate of 6.864% per annum. The increase was partially offset by the repayment and termination of our former credit facility and the redemption of $250,000 of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in May 2024. The net proceeds from our $940,534 senior secured notes due 2026 were used to make these repayments in December 2023 aggregating $700,000. Additionally, in June 2024, we redeemed $60,000 of our outstanding 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the $120,000 mortgage loan executed in May 2024.
Loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt
. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the redemption of $60,000 of our outstanding 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the $120,000 mortgage loan executed in May 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a loss on modification or early extinguishment of debt in connection with an amendment to our then credit agreement.
Income tax expense
. Income tax expense is the result of operating income we earned in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes.
Equity in net (losses) earnings of investees.
Equity in net (losses) earnings of investees is the change in the fair value of our investments in our joint ventures and also represents our proportionate share of the earnings of our equity method investment in AlerisLife. For further information regarding our investment in AlerisLife, see Notes 3 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
We present certain "non-GAAP financial measures" within the meaning of applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including funds from operations, or FFO, normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, and NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of our operating performance or as measures of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We consider these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss). We believe these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation and amortization, they may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs and, in the case of NOI, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties.
Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations
We calculate FFO and Normalized FFO as shown below. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which is net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties, equity in net earnings or losses of investees, loss on impairment of real estate assets, gains or losses on equity securities, net, if any, and including adjustments to reflect our proportionate share of FFO of our equity method investees, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. In calculating Normalized FFO, we adjust for the items shown below, including similar adjustments for our unconsolidated joint ventures, if any, and include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as an expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year. FFO and Normalized FFO are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in the agreements governing our debt, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance, and our expected needs for and availability of cash to pay our obligations. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.
Our calculations of FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and reconciliations of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements, to FFO and Normalized FFO appear in the following table. This table also provides a comparison of distributions to shareholders, FFO and Normalized FFO and net income (loss) per share for these periods.

Incentive fees under our business management agreement are payable after the end of each calendar year, are calculated based on common share total return, as defined, and are included in general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In calculating net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP, we recognize estimated business management incentive fee expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters. Although we recognize this expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters for purposes of calculating net income (loss), we do not include these amounts in the calculation of Normalized FFO until the fourth quarter, when the amount of the business management incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if any, is determined.
Property Net Operating Income (NOI)
We calculate NOI as shown below. The calculation of NOI excludes certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level results of operations. We define NOI as income from our real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that we record as depreciation and amortization. We use NOI to evaluate individual and company-wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI differently than we do.

The calculation of NOI by reportable segment is included above in this Item 2. The following table includes the reconciliation of net loss to NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal sources of cash to meet operating and capital expenses, pay our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders are the operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our leased properties, residents fees and services revenues from our managed communities and proceeds from the disposition of certain properties. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, pay our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders for at least the next 12 months. Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon:
•
our ability to receive rents from our tenants;
•
our ability to maintain or increase the occupancy of, and the rates at, our properties;
•
our and our managers' abilities to control operating expenses and capital expenses at our properties, including increased operating expenses that we may incur in response to wage and commodity price inflation, limited labor availability and increased insurance costs; and
•
our managers' abilities to maintain or increase our returns from our managed senior living communities.
Although the senior living industry has been adversely affected by a slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as economic and market conditions, there have been signs of recovery. While we are encouraged by positive trends, including increases in rates and occupancy in our SHOP segment and favorable supply and demand dynamics in the senior living industry, generally, we cannot be sure that these trends will continue to benefit us and any benefits we do realize may be uneven. While we continue to experience variability in labor, insurance and food costs in our SHOP segment, we expect increases in these costs to moderate and we continue to work with our senior living operators to manage these costs and to increase rates and occupancy at our communities, which we believe will enable our managers to generate better returns to us.
36
Table of Contents
We also continue to invest capital in our SHOP segment in order to capitalize on these positive trends and increase the probability of higher cash flows to us.
On December 21, 2023, we completed a private offering of $940.5 million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior secured notes due January 2026, with a one-year extension option. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $730.4 million after deducting initial purchaser discounts and estimated offering costs. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay in full the $450.0 million outstanding under our then secured credit facility and to redeem $250.0 million of our senior notes that were scheduled to mature in May 2024.
Until its repayment in full and termination on December 21, 2023, we had a $450.0 million credit facility that was fully drawn.
On May 30, 2024, we executed a $120.0 million fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by eight medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.864%. The net proceeds from this mortgage loan were approximately $117.1 million after deducting estimated closing costs, and we used $60.0 million of the net proceeds to partially redeem our then outstanding $500.0 million senior notes due 2025. As a result of these transactions, we have no significant debt maturities until June 2025 when $440.0 million of our senior notes will become due, and as of September 30, 2024, we had $256.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, our ratio of consolidated income available for debt service to debt service is above the 1.5x incurrence requirement under our senior notes, on a pro forma basis. We are able to refinance existing or maturing debt and issue new debt as long as this ratio is at or above 1.5x on a pro forma basis at the time of such refinancing or issuance.
Based on the significant number of unencumbered properties in our SHOP segment and our demonstrated ability to execute debt financings, we believe we will likely be able to obtain additional debt financing that will allow us to satisfy the $440.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 9.75% senior unsecured notes due June 2025.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold four properties for an aggregate sales price of $29.1 million, excluding closing costs. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold one of these properties for a sales price of $6.6 million, excluding closing costs. As of November 4, 2024, we had 28 properties under agreements or letters of intent to sell for an aggregate sales price of $348.1 million, excluding closing costs. If these sales are completed, approximately $302.1 million of the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026. We may not complete the sales of any or all of the properties we currently plan to sell. Also, we may sell some or all of these properties at amounts that are less than currently expected and/or less than the carrying values of such properties and we may incur losses on any such sales as a result. For further information regarding our dispositions, see Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Our Operating Liquidity and Resources
We generally receive minimum rents from tenants at our medical office and life science properties, triple net leased senior living communities and wellness centers monthly, we receive residents fees and services revenues, net of expenses, from our managed senior living communities monthly and we receive percentage rents from tenants at certain of our senior living communities monthly, quarterly or annually.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period was primarily due to increased NOI as a result of increased rates and occupancy at the senior living communities in our SHOP segment. Additionally, cash interest payments decreased during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period primarily
37

due to the repayment and termination of our former credit facility and the redemption of $250.0 million of our senior notes in December 2023.
Our Investing Liquidity and Resources
The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period was primarily due to a decrease in real estate improvements and an increase in proceeds from the sale of properties during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The decrease was partially offset by our purchase on February 16, 2024 of approximately 34.0% of the then outstanding AlerisLife common shares from ABP Trust at the tender offer price of $1.31 per share for a total purchase price, including transaction related costs, of $15.5 million. During the 2023 period, we tendered all of our AlerisLife common shares at $1.31 per share.

Lease related costs generally include capital expenditures to improve tenants' space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space and other leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions and tenant inducements.
(2)
Building improvements generally include capital expenditures to replace obsolete building components that extend the useful life of existing assets or other improvements to increase the marketability of the property.
(3)
Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include capital expenditures that reposition a property or result in new sources of revenue.
We generally plan to continue investing capital in our properties, including redevelopment projects, to better position these properties in their respective markets in order to increase our returns in future years.
As of September 30, 2024, we had estimated unspent leasing related obligations at our triple net leased wellness centers and our medical office and life science properties of approximately $31.4 million, of which we expect to spend approximately $20.3 million during the next 12 months. We expect to fund these obligations using operating cash flows we generate as rental income from our leased properties, residents fees and services revenues from our managed communities, cash on hand, proceeds from the disposition of certain properties and future financing activities.
We are currently in the process of redeveloping certain properties, primarily our managed senior living communities, which projects are expected to be completed at various times between 2024 and 2025. We continue to assess opportunities to redevelop other properties in our Medical Office and Life Science Portfolio and SHOP segment. These redevelopment projects may require significant capital expenditures and time to complete, and we may defer certain redevelopment projects to preserve

liquidity. Due to labor availability constraints and wage and commodity price inflation, the capital investments we plan to make may be delayed or cost more than we expect.
Our Financing Liquidity and Resources
The change in cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities for the prior period was primarily due to our execution of a $120.0 million mortgage loan during the 2024 period and $250.0 million in repayments of borrowings under our former credit facility during the 2023 period, which was partially offset by the redemption of $60.0 million of our senior notes during the 2024 period.
As of September 30, 2024, we had $256.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We typically use cash balances, net proceeds from offerings of securities, debt issuances or dispositions of assets and cash flows from our operations to fund our operations, debt repayments, distributions, acquisitions, investments, capital expenditures and other general business purposes.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders totaling approximately $7.2 million using existing cash balances. On October 16, 2024, we declared a quarterly distribution payable to common shareholders of record on October 28, 2024 in the amount of $0.01 per share, or approximately $2.4 million. We expect to pay this distribution on or about November 14, 2024 using cash on hand. For further information regarding the distribution we paid during 2024, see Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
We believe we may have access to certain types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund our operations and repay our debts and other obligations as they become due. Our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, future debt or equity transactions depends primarily upon credit market conditions and our then creditworthiness and our ability to be in compliance with our debt covenants. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit and debt ratings depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans, including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. Similarly, our ability to raise equity capital in the future will depend primarily upon equity capital market conditions and our ability to conduct our business to maintain and grow our operating cash flows. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully carry out that intention. A protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage and commodity price inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, economic downturns and a possible recession, may have various negative consequences including a decline in financing availability and increased costs for financing. Further, those conditions could also disrupt capital markets and limit our access to financing from public sources, particularly if the global financial markets experience significant disruptions.
Our $940.5 million in outstanding senior secured notes due 2026 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and senior secured basis, by the Collateral Guarantors, and on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all our subsidiaries other than the Collateral Guarantors and certain excluded subsidiaries. These notes and the guarantees provided by the Collateral Guarantors are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in each of the collateral properties and 100% of the equity interests in each of the Collateral Guarantors. No cash interest will accrue on these notes prior to maturity. The accreted value of these notes will increase at a rate of 11.25% per annum compounded semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. We are currently under agreements or letters of intent to sell 22 of the properties securing our senior secured notes due 2026 for an aggregate sales price of $302.1 million, excluding closing costs. If these sales are completed, the proceeds are required to be used to partially redeem our outstanding senior secured notes due 2026.
In January 2023, we repaid $113.6 million in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility and the commitments were reduced to $586.4 million. In February 2023, we reduced the commitments from $586.4 million to $450.0 million following our repayment of $136.4 million in outstanding borrowings under our former credit facility. Until its repayment in full and termination on December 21, 2023, we had a $450.0 million credit facility that was fully drawn. At December 21, 2023, our former credit facility required interest to be paid on borrowings at an annual rate of 8.4%, plus a facility fee of $0.3 million per quarter.
In May 2024, we executed a $120.0 million fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by eight medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.864%.
39
Table of Contents
In June 2024, we redeemed $60.0 million of our outstanding 9.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025 using proceeds from the $120.0 million mortgage loan executed in May 2024.
In January 2024, Moody's Investors Service, or Moody's, upgraded our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 ratings from Ca to Caa3 and our senior unsecured debt rating from C to Ca, and Moody's also assigned a Caa2 rating to our senior secured notes due 2026.
In January 2024, Standard & Poor's Rating Services, or Standard & Poor's, upgraded our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 rating from CCC+ to B, our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 rating from CCC+ to B and our senior unsecured debt rating from CCC- to CCC, and Standard & Poor's also assigned a B rating to our senior secured notes due 2026.
For further information regarding our outstanding debt, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Debt Covenants
Our principal debt obligations at September 30, 2024 were: (1) $2.0 billion outstanding principal amount of senior unsecured notes; (2) $940.5 million outstanding principal amount of senior secured notes; and (3) $127.9 million aggregate principal amount of mortgage notes (excluding discounts, premiums and net debt issuance costs) secured by nine properties. For further information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Our senior notes are governed by our senior notes indentures and their supplements. Our senior notes indentures and their supplements provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. Our senior notes indentures and their supplements also contain covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts and require us to maintain various financial ratios. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our senior notes indentures and their supplements and our other debt obligations. Although we continue to take steps to enhance our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity, as noted elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a protracted negative impact on the economy or the industries in which our properties and businesses operate resulting from wage or commodity price inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical risks or other economic, market or industry conditions, including the delayed recovery of the senior housing industry, economic downturns or a possible recession, may cause increased pressure on our ability to satisfy financial and other covenants. If our operating results and financial condition are significantly negatively impacted by economic conditions or otherwise, we may fail to satisfy our debt covenants and conditions.
Our senior notes indentures and their supplements do not contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. See "—Our Financing Liquidity and Resources" above for information regarding recent changes to our issuer credit rating and senior debt ratings.
Our senior unsecured notes indentures and their supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of more than $20.0 million ($50.0 million or more in the case of our senior notes indentures and supplements entered in February 2016, February 2018, June 2020, February 2021 and December 2023).
The loan agreements governing the aggregate $620.0 million secured debt financing related to the Seaport JV contain customary covenants and provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default. We no longer include this $620.0 million of secured debt financing in our condensed consolidated balance sheet following the deconsolidation of the net assets of this joint venture; however, we continue to provide certain guaranties on this debt. The debt secured by the properties included in the LSMD JV in which we own a 20% equity interest is guaranteed by this joint venture and is non-recourse to us.
Supplemental Guarantor Information
On May 28, 2020, we issued $1.0 billion of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025. We subsequently redeemed $500.0 million and $60.0 million of this debt in June 2022 and June 2024, respectively, with $440.0 million remaining outstanding. On February 3, 2021, we issued $500.0 million of our 4.375% senior notes due 2031. As of September 30, 2024, all $440.0 million of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and all $500.0 million of our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint, several and unsecured basis, by all of our subsidiaries except certain excluded subsidiaries. The notes and related guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of our and the subsidiary guarantors' secured indebtedness, respectively, to the extent of the value of the applicable collateral, and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and
40
Table of Contents
other liabilities and any preferred equity of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Our remaining $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes do not have the benefit of any guarantees.
A subsidiary guarantor's guarantee of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, as applicable, and all other obligations of such subsidiary guarantor under the indenture governing the notes will automatically terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will automatically be released from all of its obligations under such subsidiary guarantee and the indenture under certain circumstances, including on or after the date (a) the notes have an investment grade rating from two rating agencies and one of such investment grade ratings is a mid-BBB investment grade rating and (b) no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due on our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 or our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 or the respective guarantees, or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. The rights of holders of our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, as applicable, to benefit from any of the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries are subject to the prior satisfaction of claims of those subsidiaries' creditors and any preferred equity holders. As a result, our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031 and the respective guarantees are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness, guarantees and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee our 9.75% senior notes due 2025 and our 4.375% senior notes due 2031, including guarantees of other indebtedness of ours, payment obligations under lease agreements, trade payables and preferred equity.
The following tables present summarized financial information for guarantor entities and issuer, on a combined basis after eliminating (i) intercompany transactions and balances among the guarantor entities and (ii) equity in earnings from, and any investments in, any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor (dollars in thousands):

Related Person Transactions
We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR, RMR Inc., AlerisLife (including Five Star) and others related to them. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 9, 10 and 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, see the section captioned “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships. We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including businesses to which RMR or its subsidiaries provide management services.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in our condensed consolidated
41
Table of Contents
financial statements include purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and impairments of real estate and intangible assets.
A discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our Annual Report. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since the year ended December 31, 2023.
Impact of Government Reimbursement
For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, substantially all of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from our tenants' and residents' private resources, and a small amount of our NOI was generated from properties where a majority of the revenues are derived from Medicare and Medicaid payments. Nonetheless, we own, and our tenants, managers and operators operate, facilities in many states that participate in federal and state healthcare payment programs, including the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare payment programs. Also, some of our medical office and life science property tenants participate in federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs and other government healthcare payment programs.
For more information regarding the government healthcare funding and regulation of our business, please see the section captioned “Business—Government Regulation and Reimbursement” in our Annual Report and the section captioned “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Government Reimbursement” in our Annual Report.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Other than as described below, we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future.
We may in the future enter into hedge arrangements or derivative contracts from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates.
Fixed Rate Debt
In May 2024, we executed a $120.0 million fixed rate, interest only mortgage loan secured by eight medical office and life science properties. This mortgage loan matures in June 2034 and requires that interest be paid at an annual rate of 6.864%. Interest payments are due monthly and no principal payment is due until maturity. We used $60.0 million of the net proceeds to partially redeem our then outstanding $500.0 million senior notes due 2025.
Other than the transaction described above, there have been no material changes to market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a discussion of market interest rate risks associated with our fixed rate debt, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" included in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report.
Floating Rate Debt
At September 30, 2024, we did not have any floating rate debt obligations.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements may include words such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “estimate”, “will”, “may” and negatives or derivatives of these or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about: our efforts to manage costs and increase occupancy at our SHOP communities; demand for medical office and life science leased space; our future leasing activity; market demand and supply for healthcare services for older adults and senior living communities; expected costs related to the transition of certain senior living communities; our leverage; the sufficiency of our liquidity; our liquidity needs and sources; our ability to obtain additional debt financing; our capital expenditure plans and commitments; the transition of operations at certain of our senior living communities to new managers; our acquisitions and our pending or potential property dispositions; our redevelopment, repositioning and construction activities and plans; and the amount and timing of future distributions.
Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations, are based on judgments and assumptions, are inherently uncertain and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from expected future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in those forward-looking statements. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:

•
Our senior living operators' abilities to successfully and profitably operate the communities they manage for us,
•
The continuing impact of changing market practices, including those that arose or intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, or delayed returns to prior market practices on us and our managers and other operators and tenants, such as reduced demand for leased medical office, life science and other space of ours and residencies at senior living communities, increased operating costs and labor availability constraints,
•

•
Whether the aging U.S. population and increasing life spans of seniors will increase the demand for senior living communities and other medical and healthcare related properties and healthcare services,
•
Whether our tenants will renew or extend their leases or whether we will obtain replacement tenants on terms as favorable to us as our prior leases,
•
The likelihood that our tenants and residents will pay rent or be negatively impacted by continuing unfavorable market and commercial real estate industry conditions,
•
Our managers' abilities to increase or maintain rates charged to residents of our senior living communities and manage operating costs for those communities,
•
Our ability to increase or maintain occupancy at our properties on terms desirable to us,
•
Our ability to increase rents when our leases expire or renew,
•
Costs we incur and concessions we grant to lease our properties,
•
Risk and uncertainties regarding the costs and timing of development, redevelopment and repositioning activities, including as a result of prolonged high inflation, cost overruns, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, construction delays or inability to obtain necessary permits or volatility in the commercial real estate markets,
