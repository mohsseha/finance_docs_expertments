| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2023-07,Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, or ASU No. 2023-07, which requires public entities to: (i) provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items if they are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, or the CODM, and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss; (ii) provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280,Segment Reporting, or ASC 280, in interim periods; and (iii) disclose the CODM’s title and position, as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures and other disclosures. Public entities with a single reportable segment must apply all the disclosure requirements of ASU No. 2023-07, as well as all the existing segment disclosures under ASC 280. The amendments in ASU No. 2023-07 are incremental to the requirements in ASC 280 and do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. ASU No. 2023-07 should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We expect to include additional disclosures as a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2023-07; however, these changes are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, or ASU No. 2023-09, which requires public entities to enhance their annual income tax disclosures by requiring: (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 should be applied prospectively but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We expect to include additional disclosures in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements as a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2023-09; however, these changes are not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. | c-1 |  |
