| Income Tax Disclosure Text Block | Income Taxes | c-1 |  |
| Income Tax Policy Text Block | INCOME TAXES.  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and, as such, are generally not subject to federal and most state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements. We do, however, lease our managed senior living communities to our wholly owned TRSs that, unlike most of our subsidiaries, file a separate consolidated federal corporate income tax return and are subject to federal and state income taxes. Our consolidated income tax provision includes the income tax provision related to the operations of our TRSs and certain state income taxes we incur despite our taxation as a REIT. Our current income tax expense (or benefit) fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our income, including gains on the disposition of properties or losses in a particular quarter.The Income Taxes Topic of the Codification prescribes how we should recognize, measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized to the extent that it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense. | c-1 |  |

| New Accounting Pronouncements Policy Policy Text Block | RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2023-07,Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, or ASU No. 2023-07, which requires public entities to: (i) provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items if they are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, or the CODM, and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss; (ii) provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by ASC 280, Segment Reporting, or ASC 280, in interim periods; and (iii) disclose the CODM’s title and position, as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures and other disclosures. Public entities with a single reportable segment must apply all the disclosure requirements of ASU No. 2023-07, as well as all the existing segment disclosures under ASC 280. The amendments in ASU No. 2023-07 are incremental to the requirements in ASC 280 and do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. ASU No. 2023-07 should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2023-07 will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, or ASU No. 2023-09, which requires public entities to enhance its annual income tax disclosures by requiring: (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and (ii) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 should be applied prospectively but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods | c-1 |  |
